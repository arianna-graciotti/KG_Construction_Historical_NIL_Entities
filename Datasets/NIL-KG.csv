In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking. Even'the first of our native singers have found it indispensable to cultivate the style. t Some years ago Mr, and Mrs, Lacy r reached the highest Vol. 4, page 308."", 'The author of Die Vestalin, was heard to declare, that this was the first time his conceptions of the character had been fully realized. At the second performance his enthusiasm was unbounded, and he exclaimed, ‘“‘ As a singer Mademoiselle Schechner has no equal upon earth !” The impression produced by this lady, is thus described in an article printed in the Journal of Professor Voss :— “‘ Yesterday evening, Mademoiselle Schechner terminated a series of performances with a degree of éclat, which, perhaps, no other singer ever experienced. The public enthusiasm redoubled at each representation, and it is but justice to acknowledge, that never was feeling better founded. Is it not surprising that a singer, whose mame was scarcely known here eighteen months ago, should have so suddenly raised herself to the first rank, and established her claim as the first dramatic singer of the day? She has been with us but four months, and yet in that short period how,sgreat the sensation she has produced. Endowed by nature with faculties of the highest order, she has found at our theatre opportunities, denied her elsewhere, of trying her powers in the highest rank of characters; in a word, she has done justice to the music of Gluck, and has found a public to appreciate her talents, who have not been corrupted by the insipidity of modern Italian operas.” Her last performance was in Die Veséalin, for her own benefit. On entering she was hailed by peals of applause, which were redoubled at the close of her first grand air; but in the second act her triumph was still more complete. At the conclusion of her pathetic air, which she gave with a truth of expression altogether her own, handkerchiefs were seen waving from the boxes, and copies of verses were thrown upon the stage at her feet.']";1830-11-07 00:00:00;1830;;;;;NIL;;;;

Bandonelli, equally celebrated as a’ poet and as.a composer, isthe pupil of P. Teofilo, ‘who has acquired s so great a reputation by his religious compositions, and who was of the school of Clari and Sacchini. In vocal music and poetic expression he formed himself after Zingarelli. We regard Bandonelli as possessing a decided genius for poetry and a fine talent for music. His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value. He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author. If Ban‘donelli were as original, and rich in invention as he is happy in the choice of his melodies, he would acquire an immortal title to celebrity.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses.

Several times I have thought of troubling you with an article on this subject, pointing out what I should conceive some improvement in the service: I have even had the temerity to think of recommending the non-performance of some of the very old dry services and anthems (my sacrilegeous thoughts do not extend to productions by Gibbons or Purcell)—but I do say, that to people who have any ear for music, and who are in the habit of attending the different cathedrals, it must be tiresome in the extreme, especially if they are not profound contrapuntists, to hear the changes rung upon a certain set of Te Deums and. Anthems, dull enough in themselves, but rendered intolerably so by diurnal repetition. I must however notice, that at the Chapel Royal some chants of Mr. S. Wesley’s have lately been. intro= duced, that are delightful for sound harmony and originality, and that- Mr, Attwood has had performed some new commandments of his, which do the highest credit to his. judgment and science ; the construction of them is quite novel for this part of the service. This first response, ‘Lord have mercy,” &c. is formed upon a canto fermo, in plain counterpoint of four parts; canto fernio in the treble. The next response. (after the second commandment)', '‘he pretty organ parts came out very distinctly and with much delicacy. The address, which was appropriate to the occasion, was delivered by the Vicar. The rev. gentleman described the organ of voice and its mode of action in emitting musical sounds, and dwelt upon the desirability and practicability of congregational singing. Want of space prevents us from following the vicar’s address, which was . decidedly interesting and instructive, though we cannot ee with him in some of his remarks on music. After the s8 the hymn “O quanta qualia sunt illa Sabbatta” was. gang. Our observations upon the hymn “Coli Deus” may be applied to this also.

Complaints, on this head, have been made at all times: more than a century ago, Bedford, in his work entitled “The Great Abuse of Musick,” thus expresses himself :—“ It is. lamentable to consider, that when _aman comes to church for the good of his soul, in hopes that every thing there shall.inerease his devotion, the musick serves only to increase his distraction ; and he can scarcely ever hear any thing from the finger of the organist, which tends to gravity and . sobriety ; but a wanton light air, as if designed to spoil the endeavours of the minister in all the offices of our excellent church, and banish from the house of God ev ery serious thought.” This is the language ofan intrepid assailant of the “light and wanton” style of church playing which prevailed in his day, and, a — Jittle further on, he says— If any one complains of this abuse to the parishioners, their answer is, that they do not understand it, (and who does, as it is now managed 7) I know not any sober person, who can ‘understand any thing in it, except a jargon of confusion, without head or tail, including all the keys of the gamut in a promiscuous manner, without any cadence or_connexion, intermixed sometimes, with a wanton airy fancy, and at others with a heavy sordid performance, and all this. occasioned by extempore maggots in all the voluntaries and interludes, whilst the man is conceited of his own parts, because no one else understands what he would be at, and. scorns to practice such things as are tried and approved of by the best masters.”” The italics, and __the punctuation, will shew, that I have transcribed honest Arthur nost literally.']";;;;;;;NIL;no;yes;yes;Corpus

The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.']";1785-11-30 00:00:00;1785;;;;;NIL;;;;
