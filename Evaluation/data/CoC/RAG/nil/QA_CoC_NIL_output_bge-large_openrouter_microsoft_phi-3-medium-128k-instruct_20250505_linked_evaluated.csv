He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', ""Genius now appeared to be awakened. Cassati and 'Thelone¢ in Rome, Segrenzi.in Venice, Colonna in Bologna, Bassini || in Ferrara, and in Genoa, Stradela, 1 not less celebrated for his : talents than for his love and tragical end, arose to subdue the sovereignty so long usurped by bad taste. Immediately in their footsteps appeared those great harmonists Gaetano Greco, Albinoni Caldara,** the famous Giovanni Buononcini, and Pietro Saudoni, of. Bologna, who supported the Italian name with such dignity in ‘England in the midst of the applause which the compositions of Handel had so deservedly raised there. The English join toa lively attachment to their country that impartial philosophy which generalizes feelings.and ideas.

Yet those who are capable of estimating rightly the difficulties attendant on the study of music, the keen sensitiveness, the capacious intelligence, the glowing imagination, the grasp of the beautiful, and the entire comprehension of ideal subtleties, requisite for the formation of a great composer, will instinctively own, that the mind of a man like Mozart could have been hardly less transcendant and sublime than that of a Bacon, a Shakspere, or a Milton. Music has been hitherto, to the uninstructed laity, an ocean, whose surface, alone visible, has given but a shallow and superficial idea of its glories; the glitter of its exterior has dazzled men's eves into unheedfulness of what may he hid in its profundity; the reeds and weeds swimming on its surface, have been the only objects apparent to the careless and uninquiring eves of the multitude, while the priceless gems which lie buried in its bosom, have remained unseen, unsought for.

Great Britain adds to her unnumbered glories those of the nob:est inspirations of one of the noblest of arts. Twenty vears ago a composer would no more have thought cf marrving such poetry as that of Shelley to music, than of lighting his bedchaniber at nridnight with sunbeams; but now the lvrics of Shelley are es widely known, and as fully appreciated among niusicians, as among the professors of literature; and the result is a refinement of thought, an etheriality of expression. as surprising as it was unhoped for.""]","Your task is to determine the country of citizenship of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

Yet those who are capable of estimating rightly the difficulties attendant on the study of music, the keen sensitiveness, the capacious intelligence, the glowing imagination, the grasp of the beautiful, and the entire comprehension of ideal subtleties, requisite for the formation of a great composer, will instinctively own, that the mind of a man like Mozart could have been hardly less transcendant and sublime than that of a Bacon, a Shakspere, or a Milton. Music has been hitherto, to the uninstructed laity, an ocean, whose surface, alone visible, has given but a shallow and superficial idea of its glories; the glitter of its exterior has dazzled men's eves into unheedfulness of what may he hid in its profundity; the reeds and weeds swimming on its surface, have been the only objects apparent to the careless and uninquiring eves of the multitude, while the priceless gems which lie buried in its bosom, have remained unseen, unsought for. The tinselly frivolities (to speak of the present age) of such attractive tight-rope dancers as Déhler, Czerny, and a hundred others, have flung dust in the eves of those who, on all other subjects than music, are reflecting and philosophical, while the deep-laid beauties of a Mendelssohn, a Weber, or a Bennett** Like the jewell’d cups of the King Jamstid,” le entombed in neglect and apathy. A brighter sun, however. is now dawning on the musical horizon. In England, especially, in the march of intellect, music has sustained a foremost rank, and has made more rapid strides within the last ten years, than since it first was weaned in the days of Queen Elizabeth. ‘lhe Roval Academy, in Tenterden-street, and its presiding genius, Mr. Cipriani Potter, have effected uncounted benefits for the art; and out ofa dark and dreary atmosphere, have started forth, in serene splendour, a host of young musicians; and lo! Great Britain adds to her unnumbered glories those of the nob:est inspirations of one of the noblest of arts. Twenty vears ago a composer would no more have thought cf marrving such poetry as that of Shelley to music, than of lighting his bedchaniber at nridnight with sunbeams; but now the lvrics of Shelley are es widely known, and as fully appreciated among niusicians, as among the professors of literature; and the result is a refinement of thought, an etheriality of expression. as surprising as it was unhoped for.""}

Admitting that the diapason has ascended a whole tone during acentury, this note would be G flat, and there is no tenor capable of singing a piece which constantly goes up to F, G, A, B. The method of producing the voice is entirely changed, and we no longer find those clear counter-tenor voices which ascended with so much facility. J know not whether there still exist any in the choruses of our lyrical theatres. I recollect having known two individuals possessing voices of this nature; one was a chorus singer of the Opera Comigue, an excellent musician named Barbier ; he sang C in his chest voice as easily as another would G. This C was frightful I admit, but, nevertheless, it wars C sung without effort. The other counter-tenor whom I allude to, was one Pichot, a singer at the church of Notre Dame; he was very aged, and had still an extraordinarily powerful voice ; when he sang at B or C his voice sounded above all the others, and was heard all over the Cathedral; [I must add, that in his case, as in that of Barbier, the sound was not very agreeable. It was thus that tenors sang in the time of Rameau. There isin Castor et Pollur a battle song for their kind of voice: LEclatez, fieres trompettes. It is the most burlesque thing imaginable, andif any artist of the present day were capable of executing it, I would guarantee him an engagement in any lyrical theatre in Europe.', ""_ Rousseau,” says M.

En parlant ainsi de ses admirateurs, Rousseau né donne-t-il pas.des preuves irrécusables de son ingratitude, d’une’ ingratitude révoltante?

Handel was twenty-six years of age when he arrived in London, and had certainly completed his musical education. But those of his compositions which have lived are written to English words, and are precisely adapted to those calm and sober habits of drawing pleasure as much from reflection as from sensation, which your correspondent “An Encuisuman” has justly traced out as the foundations and characteristics of the music of this country. Ifthe French have any title to Lulli, who was born at Florence, and to Gluck, who was born on the frontiers of Bohemia, and whom they yet esteem to be the founders and formers of their dramatic music, we may certainly claim Handel for our own on the same ground—naturalization.

While we had neither com- posers, nor singers, nor instrumentalists, it was well to give us the best examples but since we have had an Arne, a Shield, and a Bishop—a Billington and a Braham—a Weichsell, and a Lindley, cum multis akis—surely it would redound to the honour of our nobility to hold eut some encouragement to these our countrymen ?

D/ailleurs il n’est peut-¢tre pas un dillettante qui n’ait sa phrase toute faite sur Mademoiselle Pasta, et qui ne soit mécontent de ne pas la retrouver ici; et dans Ja juste admiration que cette grande cantatrice inspire au public, le lecteur le plus bienveillant trouvera son portrait sans couleur, et mille fois au-dessous de ce qu’il attendait.”” ° If such are the difficulties which the biographer of Haydn, Mozart, and Rossini, anticipated—if he who appears to have passed the larger portion of his life in following and observing the great’ public singers of his age, feared to encounter them in attempting to describe this celebrated female, our dismay should be infinitely increased. For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p28': '‘The successor to these great names was Handel- Giant Handel with his hundred hands.” Though not a native of our country, he can hardly be dénied to us. Handel was twenty-six years of age when he arrived in London, and had certainly completed his musical education. But those of his compositions which have lived are written to English words, and are precisely adapted to those calm and sober habits of drawing pleasure as much from reflection as from sensation, which your correspondent “An Encuisuman” has justly traced out as the foundations and characteristics of the music of this country. Ifthe French have any title to Lulli, who was born at Florence, and to Gluck, who was born on the frontiers of Bohemia, and whom they yet esteem to be the founders and formers of their dramatic music, we may certainly claim Handel for our own on the same ground—naturalization.

Mozart’s grand compositions are also put to Italian words. Thus the very slight and limited acquaintance with the best example. But has it been equally wise or even fair to English talent, to lavish such immense sums:as have been annually spent upon the King’s Theatre, while nothing of the same nature has been done to assist the cultivation and progress.of an English lyric drama? When I'speak in these terms, T allude of course to the. subscriptions of the nobility and other opulent persons to the opera, which has had noblemen for its managers and supporters, while the English lyric drania has been left entirely without such extra-assistance, to make its own way by means of the body of the people. While we had neither com- posers, nor singers, nor instrumentalists, it was well to give us the best examples but since we have had an Arne, a Shield, and a Bishop—a Billington and a Braham—a Weichsell, and a Lindley, cum multis akis—surely it would redound to the honour of our nobility to hold eut some encouragement to these our countrymen ?

Among the renowned disciples of this ereat man are recorded Locatelli, Bergamasco, Geminiani, and Somis..

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.'}
