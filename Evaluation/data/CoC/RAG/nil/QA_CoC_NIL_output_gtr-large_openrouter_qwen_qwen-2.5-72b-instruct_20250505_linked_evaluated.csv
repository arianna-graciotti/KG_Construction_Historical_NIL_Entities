Miss Blair sang the treble solos with considerable taste, and was especially successful in her rendering of “I know that my Redeemer.” The choruses were generally well sung, the “ Hallelujah” and “ For unto us” being marked with great precision. Mr. H. W. George presided at the harmonium, and Mr. J. Lunn conducted.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p126': 'We never heard Madame Dulcken play better ;—in the immensely difficult quintet of Spohr, especially, and in the picturesque sonata of Beethoven, she absolutely astouished her audience. The wind instruments were delicious ; the names of Ribas, Laza rus, Jarrett, and Baumann, were a sufficient guarantee for this. The quintet of Onslow, went to perfection. We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p135': 'Bennett, and Ferrari. Mr. Willy led the band, Mr Gutteridge presided at the organ, solos were performed on the violoncello and harp, by Mr. Hausmann and Mr. Balsir Chatterton; the hall was crowded.'}

Perhaps immediately after Mendelssohn, Spohr may take his place as a living composer—though great mannerism and repeated imitations of himself, almost unfit him for a station among such a glorious company.

Not only was he denied an employment which would have barely supported him, reduced to the brink of starvation, but (what must make every feeling heart bleed,) in Italy, in that city which was to be honoured by calling him son, and by the renown with which he was to adorn her capitol, in that very city had he to endure a disgraceful law-suit. Europe would have for ever lost this great ‘poet, had not the celebrated Mariana Bulgarini, by profession a ' singer, relieved him and placed him in his former situation. This act of generosity deserves to be recorded in the list of human virtues, and must excite universal gratitude. - Incomparable woman ! Thou art certain of receiving it from all noble minds ! Ifl wish that my name, may be celebrated, and that my, writings may endure, it is hot one of my slightest motives that the sentiments of admiration inspired by thy ‘memory may descend to posterity. Yes, thy name shall live in the annals of philosophy, with that of thy friends whom thou didst protect, and whilst the remem-_ brance of so many children of opulence, deservedly despised by the ‘Wise and good—whilst those of so many vegetative automatons, who are called the great, to thedishonour of that title, shall vanish” from the recollection of man, like the impure vapours which rise from the surface of the fen. The names of Bulgarini and Meétastasio shall shine'so long as any feeling of moral good exists amongst men, and so long as genius shall receive its well-earned homage from mankind! Having attained such excellence in every style, Italy now be- came to other nations the school for all musical knowledge, to_ which the greatest foreign composers either came to study or to employ their talents in perfecting the Italian drama, especially ."", 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p313': 'The composer who succeeded to the place, as well as to the glory of Palestrina, was at once his countryman, his disciple, and his friend. Giovanni Maria Nanino was born at Vallerano, a small town.in the Roman states, about the middle of the 16th century.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p423': ""Genius now appeared to be awakened. Cassati and 'Thelone¢ in Rome, Segrenzi.in Venice, Colonna in Bologna, Bassini || in Ferrara, and in Genoa, Stradela, 1 not less celebrated for his : talents than for his love and tragical end, arose to subdue the sovereignty so long usurped by bad taste. Immediately in their footsteps appeared those great harmonists Gaetano Greco, Albinoni Caldara,** the famous Giovanni Buononcini, and Pietro Saudoni, of. Bologna, who supported the Italian name with such dignity in ‘England in the midst of the applause which the compositions of Handel had so deservedly raised there. The English join toa lively attachment to their country that impartial philosophy which generalizes feelings.and ideas. With them the name of foreigner is not as in most other countries‘a title of exclusion, or a fresh weapon in the hands of envy. They took great pleasure in obliging the three professors above mentioned, who. played in conmipetition on three separate organs in public, one taking a subject-and being answered by the others, as in ancient Greece Eschylus, Sophocles, Menander, and Philomencs were seen disputing for the reward of the tripod, or for. the privilege of having their compositions performed on the stage, amongst the applauses of the assembled people. | Expression, the soul and spirit of the art, was now cultivated ; See vol. 6, page 209.

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', 'The English nation deserves rather, as we esteem it, to be praised for their admiration of superior talent, than censured for their pursuit of every passing novelty—a charge often but incon sistently brought against the people of this country generally, but more especially against the higher patrons of art.

They.', 'The agreeable Morroni, educated in the Florentine school of Sborgi* and Guidi, is a distinguished composer, and his talent for singing is not less remarkable. He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'Catalani and the entire strength of the foreign corps vocale was mustered, and Rossini himself sung. His choice seems to be singular, for he took Cimarosa’s duet, ‘ Se fiato in corpo avete,”’ which is written for iwo bases, with Catalani, his voice being a tenor. Humour however, and not singing, is his forte. His voice is fine, and his manner displays some few proofs of cultivation, but none of a desire to be estimated as a serious singer. His execution is often’ rough and abr upt, and he confines himself generally to comic compositions. “ Largo al fuctotum dellu citta is one of his favourites. He has since sung both these things at the Cambridge Festival.

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p458': 'Catalani and the entire strength of the foreign corps vocale was mustered, and Rossini himself sung.

The performance of “Tannhduser” in an establishment devoted to the glorification of prime donne, and with a chorus more accustomed to Italian than German Opera, received as much justice as could be expected under the circumstances. Most. of the solo parts were cast to competent vocalists, and the scenery—with the exception of the “Hill of Venus,’ about as conventional a pantomime’ ‘ballet scene as can possibly be imagined—may fairly be praised throughout. We can scarcely believe that this will be a favourite opera with the singers; but if it should become a favourite with the public, there can be little doubt that it will be frequently. given, and vocalists will thus receive their first lesson in humility. Wagner may be a tyrant, but it must be remembered that composers have too long been ruled over by those who should be their loyal subjects; and if he teach them their real place in the artistic kingdom, we can readily forgive him for a little excess of zeal in carrying out so salutary a reform. We have already expressed our opinion upon Mr. Gye’s other production, Verdi's ‘‘ Aida,” a gaudy spectacle which, as it belongs to no recognized school, we may presume to be Egyptian. With such a heroine as Madame Patti, this work may form an occasional attraction next season, but we doubt whether it will be anxiously inquired for either by the subscribers or the public.

Europe would have for ever lost this great ‘poet, had not the celebrated Mariana Bulgarini, by profession a ' singer, relieved him and placed him in his former situation.

{'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p400': ""At the Royal Italian Opera we certainly have had two productions which reflect credit upon the lessee ; but both may be sdid to have been wrung from him by the pressure of pyblic opinion. The performance of “Tannhduser” in an establishment devoted to the glorification of prime donne, and with a chorus more accustomed to Italian than German Opera, received as much justice as could be expected under the circumstances. Most. of the solo parts were cast to competent vocalists, and the scenery—with the exception of the “Hill of Venus,’ about as conventional a pantomime’ ‘ballet scene as can possibly be imagined—may fairly be praised throughout. We can scarcely believe that this will be a favourite opera with the singers; but if it should become a favourite with the public, there can be little doubt that it will be frequently. given, and vocalists will thus receive their first lesson in humility. Wagner may be a tyrant, but it must be remembered that composers have too long been ruled over by those who should be their loyal subjects; and if he teach them their real place in the artistic kingdom, we can readily forgive him for a little excess of zeal in carrying out so salutary a reform. We have already expressed our opinion upon Mr. Gye’s other production, Verdi's ‘‘ Aida,” a gaudy spectacle which, as it belongs to no recognized school, we may presume to be Egyptian. With such a heroine as Madame Patti, this work may form an occasional attraction next season, but we doubt whether it will be anxiously inquired for either by the subscribers or the public. Thére is little else to record of any importance at this establishment during the season."", 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p313': 'The composer who succeeded to the place, as well as to the glory of Palestrina, was at once his countryman, his disciple, and his friend.

Europe would have for ever lost this great ‘poet, had not the celebrated Mariana Bulgarini, by profession a ' singer, relieved him and placed him in his former situation. This act of generosity deserves to be recorded in the list of human virtues, and must excite universal gratitude. - Incomparable woman ! Thou art certain of receiving it from all noble minds !

On peut dire qu’il n’y eut jamais d’entreprise plus difficile; le langage musical est ingrat et insolite ; 4 chaque instant les mots vont me manquer ; et quand j’aurais le bonheur d’en trouver pour exprimer ma pensée, ils présenteraient un sens peu clair 4 esprit du lecteur.

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', ""hear the recitative sung with the grandeur, beauty, and transition of which it appears to us capable. a ‘The praise of Madame Pasta then is, that she has attained a victory over physical impediments by the force of mind, feeling, and art. Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe. But nevertheless we must confess that these praises seem to us exaggerated, when they speak of the positive effects her sing- ing produces. The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice? Elle n’en eut jamais d’autre qu’un coeur propre a sentir vivement les moindres nuances de passion, et une admiration passionnée et allant jusqu’au ridicule pour le beau idéal. A Trieste, un pauvre enfant de trois ans qui s’approche d’elle et qui demandait ’aum6ne pour sa mére aveugle, la fait fondre en larmes sur le port oii elle se -_promenait avec quelques amis; elle lui donne tout ce qu’elle avait. - Les amis qui étaient avec elle parlent de charité, se mettent 4 louer la bonté de son coeur, etc. . Quand elle a essuyé ses larmes: ‘ Je n’accepte point vos louanges, leur dit-elle. Cet enfant m’a demandé l’auméne-d’une maniére sublime. . J’ai-vu, en un clin d’ceil, tous les malheurs de sa mére, la misére de leur maison, le manque de vétemens, le froid qu’ils souffrent bien des fois. Je ‘serais une. grande actrice si dans occasion je pouvais trouver un geste exprimant le profond malheur avec cette vérité.’ ee oo S¢ Ce sont, je crois, des milliers d’observations de ce genre, dont Mademoi- Selle Pasta avait la conscience dés l’age de six ans, qu’élle se rappelle distinctement, et dont elle se sert 4 la scéne dans le besoin, qui tui valurent'son talent et lui ont servi-de modéle.” oe a a That such are the materials which great actors draw from nature may be corroborated by many instances. We shall relate one of Garrick in confirmation, which was told to the writer of this article by the friend who was with him at the time. Garrick walking with this gentleman through the streets of London, met a butcher’s boy carrying some meat in a tray on his head, and .. whistling as he went for want of thought.’ Garrick sprung upon him, seized him by the collar, and with the most vehement gesticulations exclaimed, “ You villain, have I not told you a thousand times not to do that?” Theboy’s features underwent an immediate change to consternation, and he-stammered out “ Indeed Sir I never saw you before.’ Garrick quitted his hold, said he was mistaken, and passed on. His friend scarcely less astonished than the poor boy, asked what this could possibly mean. ‘¢ Why,” said Garrick, ‘¢ I wished to see the effect of surprize and terror upon simple nature, and I"", '‘The engagement of foreign instead of British musicians in the present work, has been made a subject of complaint against Mr. Thomson.

On peut dire qu’il n’y eut jamais d’entreprise plus difficile; le langage musical est ingrat et insolite ; 4 chaque instant les mots vont me manquer ; et quand j’aurais le bonheur d’en trouver pour exprimer ma pensée, ils présenteraient un sens peu clair 4 esprit du lecteur. D/ailleurs il n’est peut-¢tre pas un dillettante qui n’ait sa phrase toute faite sur Mademoiselle Pasta, et qui ne soit mécontent de ne pas la retrouver ici; et dans Ja juste admiration que cette grande cantatrice inspire au public, le lecteur le plus bienveillant trouvera son portrait sans couleur, et mille fois au-dessous de ce qu’il attendait.”” ° If such are the difficulties which the biographer of Haydn, Mozart, and Rossini, anticipated—if he who appears to have passed the larger portion of his life in following and observing the great’ public singers of his age, feared to encounter them in attempting to describe this celebrated female, our dismay should be infinitely increased. For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p386': ""hear the recitative sung with the grandeur, beauty, and transition of which it appears to us capable. a ‘The praise of Madame Pasta then is, that she has attained a victory over physical impediments by the force of mind, feeling, and art.

It should seem as if the composer had not dared to avail himself of a quality of voice, in the more dignified characters of tragedy, which had hitherto been entirely appropriated to the buffo parts, such as Don Gruffo, &c. It must, however, be considered as the first triumph of the base voice, which has since run so glorious a career supported by such champions as Pellegrini, Galli, Lablache, and Tamburini. Indeed, who could have made Mozart, Paisiello, or Cimarosa, believe that their more fortunate successors. would have had at their disposal, a voice deep and sonorous, which would be able to execute the rapid passages of the prima donna two octaves below; to __* We cannot understand by what process of reasoning the author of this article would set about to prove that the hero of a lyric drama should have a base in preference to a tenor voice. We admit that he should not on any aceount bea soprano ; that it would be better that he be not an alto; but here our objections cease. (Editor of Harmonicon.)'}

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand.

What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p9': ""_ Rousseau,” says M.

En parlant ainsi de ses admirateurs, Rousseau né donne-t-il pas.des preuves irrécusables de son ingratitude, d’une’ ingratitude révoltante? Je conviens avec lui que les Francais de ce tenips ravaient ni oreille, ni gout, ni Pexercice de la bonne musique ; je conviens quils étaient des barbares, et voila justement pourquoi ils applaudirent le Devin du village!

He possesses 2 warm and brilliant imagination, which perhaps is hardly enough under restraint, and thus his performance is too vivid ; he is too often seeking out novelty for his audience te follow him with unalloyed pleasure, which cannot be without some points of repose, where the mind can rest upon old associations, or where the’ feelings are allowed to subsideinto comparativecalm. Astonishment is not all that fine performance is intended to excite. Mr. Pixis has immense execution, but even in this, his imaginative now and then outstrip his physical powers, and tke results are slight inaccuracies, which detract from the general perfection of his style. On the fifth of May the veteran favorites, Messrs. Cramer, gave their annual concert, at which two daughters of Mr. F. Cramer made their first public appearance, we are happy to say before as full a room as such eminent professors as their father and uncle eught to command. Miss Cramer, the pupil of Mr. Moscheles, performed a duet written by him for the occasion with her uncle, and shewed that time would qualify her to swpport ably the distinguished name she bears. Miss Marian Cramer is the pupil of Madame de Munck, who has so completely proved her superierity as a mistress in her daughter; Madame Caradori Allan. Miss Cramer’s voice is sweet, though not powerful, but practice will probably add to its volume.

We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem. It is gratifying to the artist and honourable to the patrons of art to know and feel that such are the laws by which the human heart is generally regulated. The affluence of the country is now moreover so much increased, and the love of the fine arts is become sO necessary a concomitant of education, that there is ample room for all competitors of real merit; at the same time it must be palpable that the strain which competion lays upon the faculties of artists allows little opportunity to any but talent of the very highest order. ‘These great names were not however the only attractions with which the excited activity of the managers sought to augment the general and improve their own interest in the King’s Theatre.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p853': 'melody at the conclusion, were alike indicative of her own delicate fancy and just appreciation of style.

On Thursday there was a competition for the situation of organist, when six candidates, three ladies and three gentleman, performed a voluntary and a Psalm tune each, before Mr. Davison, the umpire, which ended in the return of Mr. Frederic Howard of Kidderminster, who was, accordingly, appointed, not, however, without much opposition on the part of some of the parishioners, who, as is alwavs ' the case, on these occasions, had their favourite candidate."", 'TheMusicalWorld_1843-038.txt_p38': 'At eighteen he set out for Italy, but went no farther than Milan; his pecuniary resources being exhausted, he was compelled to return to France, and he engaged himself as violinist in the orchestra of a party who were making a tour in the south of France. He was enabled, in the course of a few years, to return to Dijon, where he was offered the situation of organist; but what he desired was fame, which prompted him to visit Paris. He refused the offer and hastened to the capital; there it was necessary he should live: an organist’s place would furnish him with the means; there was a vacancy at the church of Sazat Paul ; it was to be filled up by election; Rameau was a candidate ; his opponent, Dagnin, was successful; he was obliged to leave Paris; an organist was required for the church of Saint Etienne at Lille, where he also offered himself and was accepted; but he only remained a short time in this town. His brother, a very skilful organist at the cathedral of Clermont en Auvergne (which he was about to quit in order to settle at Dijon) offered him the reversion of his situation ; in order to accept this, he was obliged to sign an engagement for a long term.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p867': '‘Sontag, -Mesdames Schutz and Stockhausen (the latter came late into the field), have made good their stand with Pasta, Caradori, and Brambilla.

The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation.

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', ""hear the recitative sung with the grandeur, beauty, and transition of which it appears to us capable. a ‘The praise of Madame Pasta then is, that she has attained a victory over physical impediments by the force of mind, feeling, and art. Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe. But nevertheless we must confess that these praises seem to us exaggerated, when they speak of the positive effects her sing- ing produces. The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice? Elle n’en eut jamais d’autre qu’un coeur propre a sentir vivement les moindres nuances de passion, et une admiration passionnée et allant jusqu’au ridicule pour le beau idéal. A Trieste, un pauvre enfant de trois ans qui s’approche d’elle et qui demandait ’aum6ne pour sa mére aveugle, la fait fondre en larmes sur le port oii elle se -_promenait avec quelques amis; elle lui donne tout ce qu’elle avait. - Les amis qui étaient avec elle parlent de charité, se mettent 4 louer la bonté de son coeur, etc. . Quand elle a essuyé ses larmes: ‘ Je n’accepte point vos louanges, leur dit-elle. Cet enfant m’a demandé l’auméne-d’une maniére sublime. . J’ai-vu, en un clin d’ceil, tous les malheurs de sa mére, la misére de leur maison, le manque de vétemens, le froid qu’ils souffrent bien des fois. Je ‘serais une. grande actrice si dans occasion je pouvais trouver un geste exprimant le profond malheur avec cette vérité.’ ee oo S¢ Ce sont, je crois, des milliers d’observations de ce genre, dont Mademoi- Selle Pasta avait la conscience dés l’age de six ans, qu’élle se rappelle distinctement, et dont elle se sert 4 la scéne dans le besoin, qui tui valurent'son talent et lui ont servi-de modéle.” oe a a That such are the materials which great actors draw from nature may be corroborated by many instances.

We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem. It is gratifying to the artist and honourable to the patrons of art to know and feel that such are the laws by which the human heart is generally regulated. The affluence of the country is now moreover so much increased, and the love of the fine arts is become sO necessary a concomitant of education, that there is ample room for all competitors of real merit; at the same time it must be palpable that the strain which competion lays upon the faculties of artists allows little opportunity to any but talent of the very highest order. ‘These great names were not however the only attractions with which the excited activity of the managers sought to augment the general and improve their own interest in the King’s Theatre.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p367': '“6 J E céde A Ja tentation d’essayer un portrait musicale de Mademoiselle Pasta. On peut dire qu’il n’y eut jamais d’entreprise plus difficile; le langage musical est ingrat et insolite ; 4 chaque instant les mots vont me manquer ; et quand j’aurais le bonheur d’en trouver pour exprimer ma pensée, ils présenteraient un sens peu clair 4 esprit du lecteur. D/ailleurs il n’est peut-¢tre pas un dillettante qui n’ait sa phrase toute faite sur Mademoiselle Pasta, et qui ne soit mécontent de ne pas la retrouver ici; et dans Ja juste admiration que cette grande cantatrice inspire au public, le lecteur le plus bienveillant trouvera son portrait sans couleur, et mille fois au-dessous de ce qu’il attendait.”” ° If such are the difficulties which the biographer of Haydn, Mozart, and Rossini, anticipated—if he who appears to have passed the larger portion of his life in following and observing the great’ public singers of his age, feared to encounter them in attempting to describe this celebrated female, our dismay should be infinitely increased. For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p386': ""hear the recitative sung with the grandeur, beauty, and transition of which it appears to us capable. a ‘The praise of Madame Pasta then is, that she has attained a victory over physical impediments by the force of mind, feeling, and art. Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe. But nevertheless we must confess that these praises seem to us exaggerated, when they speak of the positive effects her sing- ing produces. The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice? Elle n’en eut jamais d’autre qu’un coeur propre a sentir vivement les moindres nuances de passion, et une admiration passionnée et allant jusqu’au ridicule pour le beau idéal. A Trieste, un pauvre enfant de trois ans qui s’approche d’elle et qui demandait ’aum6ne pour sa mére aveugle, la fait fondre en larmes sur le port oii elle se -_promenait avec quelques amis; elle lui donne tout ce qu’elle avait. - Les amis qui étaient avec elle parlent de charité, se mettent 4 louer la bonté de son coeur, etc. . Quand elle a essuyé ses larmes: ‘ Je n’accepte point vos louanges, leur dit-elle. Cet enfant m’a demandé l’auméne-d’une maniére sublime. . J’ai-vu, en un clin d’ceil, tous les malheurs de sa mére, la misére de leur maison, le manque de vétemens, le froid qu’ils souffrent bien des fois. Je ‘serais une. grande actrice si dans occasion je pouvais trouver un geste exprimant le profond malheur avec cette vérité.’ ee oo S¢ Ce sont, je crois, des milliers d’observations de ce genre, dont Mademoi- Selle Pasta avait la conscience dés l’age de six ans, qu’élle se rappelle distinctement, et dont elle se sert 4 la scéne dans le besoin, qui tui valurent'son talent et lui ont servi-de modéle.” oe a a That such are the materials which great actors draw from nature may be corroborated by many instances.
