Miss Weller fully sustained the high reputation which she has acquired as a pianist, perf..rming with taste and brilliancy. Miss Anna Delancy Weller made her debut on this evening, and played with her sister spiritedly and correctly. Mr. Henry Aldridge, the leader of the Philharmonic Concerts, presided at the pianoforte with great steadiness.'}

Humour however, and not singing, is his forte. His voice is fine, and his manner displays some few proofs of cultivation, but none of a desire to be estimated as a serious singer. His execution is often’ rough and abr upt, and he confines himself generally to comic compositions. “ Largo al fuctotum dellu citta is one of his favourites. He has since sung both these things at the Cambridge Festival. As an accompanist, he is powerful rather than judicious. “I do not know how he does it,”’ said a lady of quality, intending high commendation, “ but you would never suppose so much sound could proceed from one piano forte.”’ One of the most singular, yet most striking circumstances attending these as well as the public concerts, is the continual repetition of the very same pieces, night after night. With every possible allowance for the power which certain songs convey of manitesting the particular attributes of singers and fur the superior excellence of the compositions chosen, it is nevertheless astonishing that the auditors are not completely weary of hearing “‘ Sento O Dio,” and “ Se mai turbo,”’ Che faro,” “ Di tanti palpili,” &c. &c. 30 eternally repeated ; and in whatever degree the singer may be perfected by this course, he must also lose no inconsiderable portion of energy by the tiresome operation of singing the same airs night after night.

This anecdote, characteristic of the musical taste of messieurs the English, which Lafont recals with much laughter, and, perhaps, also, the historical citations in Charles VI., always relative to England, as it is so pleasantly said in the Bourgmestre de Saardam, have disturbed the patriotic bile of our profound critic. We are really sorry; but his rude style will never make us recognize his competence in matters of art, any more than the musical feeling ot his compatriots—and to justify this opinion it is only necessary to glance retrospectively at a few facts relative to music in England.” But we must take wind.

We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem. It is gratifying to the artist and honourable to the patrons of art to know and feel that such are the laws by which the human heart is generally regulated. The affluence of the country is now moreover so much increased, and the love of the fine arts is become sO necessary a concomitant of education, that there is ample room for all competitors of real merit; at the same time it must be palpable that the strain which competion lays upon the faculties of artists allows little opportunity to any but talent of the very highest order. ‘These great names were not however the only attractions with which the excited activity of the managers sought to augment the general and improve their own interest in the King’s Theatre.', 'On the 15th February, M.

{'TheMusicalWorld_1843-036.txt_p9': 'Good ! we recognize in these delicacies of hypercriticism English politeness and humour We are informed that the wrath of the worthy English journalist against ourselves arose from an article inserted in No. 26. of the Gazette in the month of June last, under the title of Physiognomy of the concert public in the various capitals of Europe, in which we related an incident that occurred to our celebrated (!!) violinist, Lafont, at the Duke of Wellington’s. This anecdote, characteristic of the musical taste of messieurs the English, which Lafont recals with much laughter, and, perhaps, also, the historical citations in Charles VI., always relative to England, as it is so pleasantly said in the Bourgmestre de Saardam, have disturbed the patriotic bile of our profound critic. We are really sorry; but his rude style will never make us recognize his competence in matters of art, any more than the musical feeling ot his compatriots—and to justify this opinion it is only necessary to glance retrospectively at a few facts relative to music in England.” But we must take wind. M. Blanchard, be it said, is blagueur en chef to the Gazette, and, therefore, obliged, for the sake of his salary, to write whichever way its proprietor, M.

We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem. It is gratifying to the artist and honourable to the patrons of art to know and feel that such are the laws by which the human heart is generally regulated. The affluence of the country is now moreover so much increased, and the love of the fine arts is become sO necessary a concomitant of education, that there is ample room for all competitors of real merit; at the same time it must be palpable that the strain which competion lays upon the faculties of artists allows little opportunity to any but talent of the very highest order. ‘These great names were not however the only attractions with which the excited activity of the managers sought to augment the general and improve their own interest in the King’s Theatre.', 'TheHarmonicon_1833-005.txt_p545': 'On the 15th February, M.

The choir, which numbered about sixty voices, rendered the pieces with correctness and precision. Mr. Josias Wells conducted, and Mr. Joseph Homer presided at the organ. The instrument, built by G.

Hoimshaw, of Birmingham. : ; JsppurcH.—A performance of the Messiak was given by the Musical Association, on January 28th, to a crowded audience.

Miss Blair sang the treble solos with considerable taste, and was especially successful in her rendering of “I know that my Redeemer.” The choruses were generally well sung, the “ Hallelujah” and “ For unto us” being marked with great precision.

But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""}

He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style.

Mr. Lorenzo Daponte has t a very curious flourish in the books of the opera, in which he says: ‘ we sigh no more for Malibran!’ and an enormous puff for the Italian artists in general, making some comparisons which had been better let alone.

Miss Cramer, the pupil of Mr. Moscheles, performed a duet written by him for the occasion with her uncle, and shewed that time would qualify her to swpport ably the distinguished name she bears. Miss Marian Cramer is the pupil of Madame de Munck, who has so completely proved her superierity as a mistress in her daughter; Madame Caradori Allan. Miss Cramer’s voice is sweet, though not powerful, but practice will probably add to its volume. The reception of the young ladies was flattering.'}

A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand.

In_deed he appears to write but very little, and this perhaps may be “partly accounted for by his well known love for general learning, and by the eclat which always attends his performance on the organ. Writing in the style our author has adopted, is a laborious task to all; but his extemporancous flights, though unatiainable by others, cost him nothing, and are well caiculated to ebstract him frony the drudgery of the desk and the waste of “ midnight oil.” Guar readers will easily imagine that the service now under consideration, coming from one so well acquainted with the writings of the greatest church composers, is distinguished by sweet and appropriate melody in many places—The harmony likewise is often very pure, and the modulations are truly ecclesiastical ; but the chief excellence of this composition arises from a total absence of all that is vulgar or theatrical. In it we discover no lack-a-daisical chromatics nor. stage effects, but the whole flows on with that simplicity which should ever be the leading characteristic of music which is intended for the service of the temple.'}

Mr. Pixis has immense execution, but even in this, his imaginative now and then outstrip his physical powers, and tke results are slight inaccuracies, which detract from the general perfection of his style. On the fifth of May the veteran favorites, Messrs. Cramer, gave their annual concert, at which two daughters of Mr. F. Cramer made their first public appearance, we are happy to say before as full a room as such eminent professors as their father and uncle eught to command. Miss Cramer, the pupil of Mr. Moscheles, performed a duet written by him for the occasion with her uncle, and shewed that time would qualify her to swpport ably the distinguished name she bears. Miss Marian Cramer is the pupil of Madame de Munck, who has so completely proved her superierity as a mistress in her daughter; Madame Caradori Allan. Miss Cramer’s voice is sweet, though not powerful, but practice will probably add to its volume. The reception of the young ladies was flattering.'}

His writings are chiefly .histerical notes upon the progress “of the operatic, as seen in the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, and in the coneatenations of Meyerbeer, Berlioz, and Wagner.

Many would not agree witheall that he has written upon Gounod; but he prophesied the success of the Faust, and as his prophecy was fulfilled, he has, so far, the best of\'the argument. W. hen Mr. Chorley first came before the public as an operatic critic, the Italian Opera was siniply a grand display of song; the singers were all in al’, the band was of small importance, and the scenery a mere thing of shreds and patches.

At the second performance his enthusiasm was unbounded, and he exclaimed, ‘“‘ As a singer Mademoiselle Schechner has no equal upon earth !” The impression produced by this lady, is thus described in an article printed in the Journal of Professor Voss :— “‘ Yesterday evening, Mademoiselle Schechner terminated a series of performances with a degree of éclat, which, perhaps, no other singer ever experienced. The public enthusiasm redoubled at each representation, and it is but justice to acknowledge, that never was feeling better founded. Is it not surprising that a singer, whose mame was scarcely known here eighteen months ago, should have so suddenly raised herself to the first rank, and established her claim as the first dramatic singer of the day? She has been with us but four months, and yet in that short period how,sgreat the sensation she has produced. Endowed by nature with faculties of the highest order, she has found at our theatre opportunities, denied her elsewhere, of trying her powers in the highest rank of characters; in a word, she has done justice to the music of Gluck, and has found a public to appreciate her talents, who have not been corrupted by the insipidity of modern Italian operas.” Her last performance was in Die Veséalin, for her own benefit. On entering she was hailed by peals of applause, which were redoubled at the close of her first grand air; but in the second act her triumph was still more complete.

Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe. But nevertheless we must confess that these praises seem to us exaggerated, when they speak of the positive effects her sing- ing produces. The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice?

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'and Mrs, Knyvett—and the second was, thatno consideration could make her consent so to tax a brother professor.

Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p846': 'and Mrs, Knyvett—and the second was, thatno consideration could make her consent so to tax a brother professor. The result was, that Mr. and Mrs. Knyvett’s concert wassupported by their friends, consisting principally of the subscribers to the Antient Concertbut the public were drawn off by the irresistible desire to hear Pasta and Velluti* together. Here however the artists had to complain of the unfair assumption of their previously announced nights—an encroachment which can be justified, as it was sup‘ported, only by power and by contempt of those rules of courtesy which have hitherto been and ought always to be observed between the professors of liberal art.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p842': 'The great passport to public favour, and it is as sudden in its exaltation of the fame of singers as ilis great in power, is the King’s Theatre—this has been frequently the subject of remark, but this season has confirmed it more than. ever with regard to the effect upon the Benefit Concerts. We are. warranted. in saying that even where the most’ extensive personal connection has seemed to favour the artist’s right to public patronage, the concerts have failed from the absence or the opposition of the leading stars of the opera. Mr. Lindley, than whom there is not a finer artist in the world nor a man more meritorious from: long and-universal ser vices, had a room which scarcely paid his expences. Mr. and Mrs. Knyvett and Mr. Vaughan were exposed, if it be possible, to more severe mortification. Long after their nights were fixed and publicly announced, concerts said to be given .'}

The public enthusiasm redoubled at each representation, and it is but justice to acknowledge, that never was feeling better founded. Is it not surprising that a singer, whose mame was scarcely known here eighteen months ago, should have so suddenly raised herself to the first rank, and established her claim as the first dramatic singer of the day?

This is an opera which will afford the professor profitable amusement, and the well-informed amateur delight; but we have an unpleasant, lurking suspicion, that it savours more of the olive than the honey; and, therefore, may not be so readily swallowed as some other operas; at least we fear that the ‘most respectable public,” as the manager ‘terms them, will prove our suspicion just, and we are sure that they ought not todo so. Mr. Lorenzo Daponte has t a very curious flourish in the books of the opera, in which he says: ‘ we sigh no more for Malibran!’ and an enormous puff for the Italian artists in general, making some comparisons which had been better let alone. He says that the company procured by him shall merit the gratitude of the public; that we must all learn Italian without delay; and that he has got a gentleman in the person of one Dr. Montresor, who wiil assist him in teach- ing us.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces. A hymn by Haydn, a quartet, a Salva Regina, of great power, by Danzi—an exquisite quartet and treble solo from Mozart—a prayer and choral motet, very learnedly put together by Schict, are all nearly equally re- \x0c 254 a . ° NOVELLO’S MOTETS. markable for solemnity and grandeur—a quartet and base solo from Winter are ina lighter but more captivating manner. A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand. To.', ""occasion entrusted to Mr. Horsley, who narrated the objects of the society with the eloquence of plainness and truth, and it made its way tothe heart. Sevenaged musicians, thirty-nine widows, and twenty-six orphans, have this year experienced the benefits this association confers. Contrary to the custom at such dinners, no collection is.made, but the impression is left tothe knowledge of the good effected, and to the feeling the very fine instrumental and ‘vocal music performed, inspires. Several new subscribers were announced. There are, our readers will remember, two societies for nearly the same objects—the Royal Society of Musicians, and the New Musical Fund. Might not the common aims of both be better promoted by an union of interests ? The theatres have produced little novelty: this year. The presentation of Mr. Sinclair, “ on his arrival from Italy,” as the court circular says, has been the principal]. A ‘correspondent in the first article of our last Number (page 10 of this volume) has drawn a pretty accurate outline of this gentleman’ s improvements by foreign travel. He demonstrates in a manner not to be mistaken, the erroneous ‘notion that after a certain period of life a_ new style may be formed or engrafted upon an old one. 'Whenever this has been done, it has been done, we will venture to affirm, only by persons of more than ordinary intellect, and of profound judgment and of considerable’ self-knowledge. . Mr. Sinclair has gathered up exotic graces without number and without assimilation ; his singing is truly “‘an unweeded garden,” or to sum up all in one phrase, it exhibits the very best specimen of the very worst taste it ever fell to our lot to hear. That natural organic powers of such an order should be so mis-directed is peculiarly unfortunate, for Mr. Sinclair might have made a fine ."", 'The agreeable Morroni, educated in the Florentine school of Sborgi* and Guidi, is a distinguished composer, and his talent for singing is not less remarkable. He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.']","Your task is to determine the country of citizenship of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces. A hymn by Haydn, a quartet, a Salva Regina, of great power, by Danzi—an exquisite quartet and treble solo from Mozart—a prayer and choral motet, very learnedly put together by Schict, are all nearly equally re- \x0c 254 a . ° NOVELLO’S MOTETS. markable for solemnity and grandeur—a quartet and base solo from Winter are ina lighter but more captivating manner. A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand. To.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p561': ""occasion entrusted to Mr. Horsley, who narrated the objects of the society with the eloquence of plainness and truth, and it made its way tothe heart. Sevenaged musicians, thirty-nine widows, and twenty-six orphans, have this year experienced the benefits this association confers. Contrary to the custom at such dinners, no collection is.made, but the impression is left tothe knowledge of the good effected, and to the feeling the very fine instrumental and ‘vocal music performed, inspires. Several new subscribers were announced. There are, our readers will remember, two societies for nearly the same objects—the Royal Society of Musicians, and the New Musical Fund. Might not the common aims of both be better promoted by an union of interests ? The theatres have produced little novelty: this year. The presentation of Mr. Sinclair, “ on his arrival from Italy,” as the court circular says, has been the principal]. A ‘correspondent in the first article of our last Number (page 10 of this volume) has drawn a pretty accurate outline of this gentleman’ s improvements by foreign travel. He demonstrates in a manner not to be mistaken, the erroneous ‘notion that after a certain period of life a_ new style may be formed or engrafted upon an old one. 'Whenever this has been done, it has been done, we will venture to affirm, only by persons of more than ordinary intellect, and of profound judgment and of considerable’ self-knowledge. . Mr. Sinclair has gathered up exotic graces without number and without assimilation ; his singing is truly “‘an unweeded garden,” or to sum up all in one phrase, it exhibits the very best specimen of the very worst taste it ever fell to our lot to hear. That natural organic powers of such an order should be so mis-directed is peculiarly unfortunate, for Mr. Sinclair might have made a fine ."", 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p250': 'The agreeable Morroni, educated in the Florentine school of Sborgi* and Guidi, is a distinguished composer, and his talent for singing is not less remarkable. He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.'}

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'At the fourth concert, on the roth ult., a very good performance of Beethoven’s Choral Symphony was given, the principal vocal parts being carefully rendered by Madame Blanche Cole, Miss Enriquez, Mr. Henry Guy and Mr. Wadmore. A new pianist, Herr Lodovico Breitner, displayed much power and facile execution; but we should like to hear him in more exacting music than the showy Concerto in E flat, of Liszt, before pronouncing any judgment upon his artistic qualifications.
