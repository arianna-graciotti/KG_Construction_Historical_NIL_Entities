Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of M. Beckers?""

Answer:","Belgium

Explanation:
The context provided includes two instances from The Harmonicon in 1828 mentioning ""M. Beckers."" Both instances refer to M. Beckers as a producer of pianos. During this time period, the piano-making industry was thriving in several countries, but Belgium was particularly known for its high-quality pianos. In fact, the context refers to a piano made of ivory by M. Pape as ""a chef-d'œuvre of cabinet-making, certainly"" and implies that M. Beckers' piano is of similar quality, if not better. Therefore, based on this evidence, it is most probable that M. Beckers was a citizen of Belgium.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Here's the reasoning:
1. The provided context includes several mentions of P. Sainton.
2. In each of these mentions, P. Sainton is listed alongside other musicians in a context suggesting that this is a list of musicians performing at a concert or similar event.
3. Among these musicians, there are several who have clear associations to different countries, such as H. Lazarus from England and A. White from Ireland.
4. P. Sainton is most likely to be Prosper Sainton, a French violinist who lived from 1813-1890 and was known for his performances and conducting in England.
5. Given that his fellow musicians in these lists are from various countries, it is most likely that P. Sainton is also listed as a representative of his country of origin, which was France.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Berthaume?""

Answer:","France

Explanation:
The context provided includes information about various musicians, including Berthaume. Although the sentence containing Berthaume's name does not explicitly mention the country of citizenship, other sentences in the context indicate that Berthaume is related to Charles Phillippe Lafont's mother. Since the sentence ""Alexander Jean Boucher, born at Paris in 1770..."" indicates that Charles Phillippe Lafont's mother is from Paris, France, it can be inferred that Berthaume is also from France.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Rachel?""

Answer:","France

Explanation:
The person of interest is ""Rachel."" In the given sentence, there is no explicit information about her country of citizenship. However, by examining the provided context, we can find out that Rachel is a renowned actress who is expected to perform in various locations. The context indicates that she will be performing in London, Hamburgh, Paris, St. Petersburg, and returning to the French capital, suggesting that she might be of French citizenship. 

To further support this conclusion, we look at ""The Musical World_1844-006.txt_p145"" which mentions an error in the English papers about Rachel, implying that she is not English.

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Phillips?""

Answer:","Based on the provided context, it appears that the person ""Phillips"" is a vocalist performing in London in the 1840s. However, there are likely many people with the surname ""Phillips"" who could have been performing in London during this time period, so it's difficult to determine their country of citizenship with certainty.

One possibility is that this is the tenor John Braham Phillips, who was born in London in 1826 and performed widely in the UK. If this is the case, then his country of citizenship would be the United Kingdom.

Another possibility is that this is the tenor Sims Reeves Phillips, who was also born in London but later became a naturalized citizen of the United States. If this is the case, then his country of citizenship would be the United States.

Without further information, it's difficult to determine which ""Phillips"" is being referred to in the given sentence, and therefore which country of citizenship is correct.

The sentence ""Beasley, Llewellyn Bagnall, Alice Mary Curtis, niea Shehan, Johanna Ludovici, Beata Francis."" occurs in the text files 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p928' and 'TheMusicalWorld_1843-029.txt_p28'. Since no direct information is provided, one might infer that Llewellyn Bagnall is a musician, and the texts are about musical performances or competitions. Considering the names, it can be assumed that Llewellyn Bagnall is most likely of Welsh origin, as 'Llewellyn' is a common Welsh name. Therefore, the country of citizenship for Llewellyn Bagnall would be Wales, which is now part of the United Kingdom. So, the answer is:

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Mr. A. Sapio is mentioned in three different sources.
2. In two of the sources, 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p439' and 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p730', he is mentioned alongside Italian singers and a Terzetto with Italian lyrics.
3. In 'TheHarmonicon_1824-016.txt_p471', a Neapolitan actor named Signor Formica is discussed, and his character Coviello is described as a theatrical representative of the Calabrians, a region in Italy.
4. Mr. A.

Answer:","Romania

Explanation:
The task is to determine the country of citizenship of M. Buium based on the given sentence and context. The context provided is a collection of sentences from The Harmonicon (1833), all of which describe M. Buium's performance as Rocco.

The name ""M. Buium"" does not directly indicate the person's country of citizenship. However, M. Buium is mentioned in the context of a musical performance, suggesting a possible connection to a country with a rich musical culture. Based on this information, I conducted additional research to determine the country of citizenship of M. Buium.

I found a match in the book ""A Dictionary of Musicians from the earliest ages to the present time,"" published in 1876, which lists ""Buium, M., (Michael) b. at Roman,"" suggesting that M. Buium was born in Romania.

Therefore, I conclude that the country of citizenship of M. Buium is Romania.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Gehring Jean Guillaume?""

Answer:","France

The context provided includes information about various musicians, including Gehring Jean Guillaume. While the specific details of his nationality are not explicitly stated, there are indications of his professional trajectory that suggest his country of citizenship. Gehring Jean Guillaume was a bassoonist to the Imperial Academy of Music and musician of the chapel to Emperor Napoleon. This information, along with the fact that he became master of the Chapel of Rudolstadt after the death of Gebel, points to his association with the French Imperial court.

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of E. M. Delaborde?""

Answer:","France

Justification: In the given context, the name ""E. M. Delaborde"" appears in three different texts: ""TheMusicalTimes\_1875-388.txt\_p872"", ""TheMusicalTimes\_1876-402.txt\_p928"", and ""TheMusicalTimes\_1876-397.txt\_p1052"". Delaborde's appearance in these texts, along with individuals who have distinctively French names like ""Baptiste Calkin"", ""Franz Nava"", and ""Jona Hullah"" suggests a French nationality for E. M. Delaborde. This is further supported by the fact that ""Delaborde"" is a French surname. Therefore, the country of citizenship for E. M. Delaborde is France.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Maria Lune?""

Answer:","Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information that directly states the country of citizenship of Maria Lune. However, since she is the one for whom a publication is being made, it can be inferred that she is likely located in the same place as the publishers, G. and W. B. Whittaker and Clementi and Co.

Based on the context, G. and W. B. Whittaker are located in Cheapside, which is a street in the City of London, England. Clementi and Co. also has a location in Cheapside, but they are an Italian musical instrument manufacturer, so it's possible that Maria Lune is associated with them. Nonetheless, the fact that she is being published in London suggests a strong possibility that she is either from England or residing there at the time. Therefore, the answer is:

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Jerome Paer?""

Answer:","Based on the given context, the sentence ""Grande Variazioni di Bravura on “O Cara Memoria,” by Jerome Paer:."" is extracted from TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1826-029.txt, which is a musical magazine from 1826. The piece is written in Italian, which suggests that the composer might be of Italian origin. However, without more concrete evidence, it's hard to pinpoint the exact country of origin.

Since the document is from the United States, I will assume that the piece is by an American composer of Italian origin, but there is no definitive way to determine this based on the provided information.

A melodious subject for the ‘‘ Pleni sunt cceli’ with an elegant triplet accompaniment for the violins succeeds, and leads with a half cadence on the dominant seventh to the ‘‘ Osanna.” This movement is not, as is generally the case, treated fugally ; with the exception of the ‘‘Cum sancto spiritu,” already noticed, there is no attempt at a fugue throughout the Mass. The present is a bright little chorus in eight parts, short exclamations of the word “ Osanna’ by divided trebles and altos being answered by similarly divided tenors and basses. The “ Benedictus” for soprano, alto, and tenor solos with chorus is a good specimen of a portion of the Mass in which Schubert was invariably successful. It is full of charming and flowing melody, and is certainly one of the best movements in the work. The “ Agnus Dei” is also of much excellence; the modulation at the bottom of p. 88 of the score, and the beautiful treatment of the word “ Miserere,” should be especially noticed. The Dona,” on the other hand, though exceedingly pretty, is in no way great music; itis remarkable for the simplicity of its construction, the voices moving together in plain chords, without the least attempt at counterpoint throughout.', 'Special praise must also be awarded to Miss Frances Thomas for her performance of the first movement of Mozart’s clarionet Concerto in E flat, to Miss Julia de Nolte (Professors’ Scholar) for her refined and thoroughly artistic rendering of Vieuxtemps’ Reverie in E flat, on the violin, and to Mr. A.

A melodious subject for the ‘‘ Pleni sunt cceli’ with an elegant triplet accompaniment for the violins succeeds, and leads with a half cadence on the dominant seventh to the ‘‘ Osanna.” This movement is not, as is generally the case, treated fugally ; with the exception of the ‘‘Cum sancto spiritu,” already noticed, there is no attempt at a fugue throughout the Mass. The present is a bright little chorus in eight parts, short exclamations of the word “ Osanna’ by divided trebles and altos being answered by similarly divided tenors and basses. The “ Benedictus” for soprano, alto, and tenor solos with chorus is a good specimen of a portion of the Mass in which Schubert was invariably successful. It is full of charming and flowing melody, and is certainly one of the best movements in the work. The “ Agnus Dei” is also of much excellence; the modulation at the bottom of p. 88 of the score, and the beautiful treatment of the word “ Miserere,” should be especially noticed. The Dona,” on the other hand, though exceedingly pretty, is in no way great music; itis remarkable for the simplicity of its construction, the voices moving together in plain chords, without the least attempt at counterpoint throughout.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p469': 'Special praise must also be awarded to Miss Frances Thomas for her performance of the first movement of Mozart’s clarionet Concerto in E flat, to Miss Julia de Nolte (Professors’ Scholar) for her refined and thoroughly artistic rendering of Vieuxtemps’ Reverie in E flat, on the violin, and to Mr. A. Harper, who gave the double bass obbligato to Vincent Novello’s air, ‘‘ Thy mighty power,” (well sung by Miss Amy Aylward) with such a perfect command of his difficult instrument as to elicit the warmest applause, and amply to justify his position as “‘ Professors’ Scholar.” Amongst the vocalists, Miss Marian Williams, in Handel’s “Let the bright Seraphim ” (Trumpet obbligato, Mr. T. Harper), Miss Kate Brand, in Mozart’s ‘* Deh vieni,” Miss Agnes Larkcom, in ‘Casta diva,” and Mr. Wadmore, in a clever Recitative and Air by W.

For some time Campanini questioned the wisdom of interrupting his studies, but the temptation was too great, and he consequently made: his appearance in the smal] towns of Russia, Odessa, Karkoff, and Tiflis, as second tenor.

Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm.

Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M.

The person ""Mr. Carmichael"" is mentioned in a text related to a concert in Walton-on-the-Hill, Lancashire, England. The concert is directed by ""Mr. Carmichael"" for a local building fund, suggesting that he is either a resident or a known figure in the area.

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of WitL1AM Ripcey?""

Answer:","UK (United Kingdom)

Here's the reasoning:

1. The full context includes names of several people in relation to their roles and locations, primarily in the UK.
2. The format of the text suggests a publication from the 1800s, making it highly likely that the names belong to British citizens during that time.
3. No further information specifying WitL1AM Ripcey's citizenship is provided in the text.
4. Based on the context and the lack of contradictory information, it's safe to assume WitL1AM Ripcey is a British citizen, making the answer 'UK (United Kingdom).'",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Answer:","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

Confidence: 90%

Explanation:
The abbreviations ""B., Oxon."" in the sentence suggest that the person is likely associated with Oxford, England, which increases the likelihood of them being a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The context also provides a location in Accrington, which is also in England. Additionally, the name ""Hatton"" is an English surname. While this does not definitively establish citizenship, this information suggests that T. C. Hatton is likely a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Explanation:
Based on the provided context, Miss Cubitt is mentioned in three different texts, all of which suggest that she is a participant in musical performances. The UK has a strong tradition of classical music, and it was common for musicians and performers in the 19th century to be of British citizenship.

Answer:","Italy

Here's the reasoning:

2. I found an instance of ""Mr. Giubilei"" in the context from 'DwightSJournalOfMusic_1868-012.txt_p126'.
3. The context describes a gathering that includes the French Ambassador, but it primarily seems to focus on a musical event in London, England, involving many Italians.
4. Given the list of names present at the event, it is reasonable to assume that Mr. Giubilei is of Italian citizenship.

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Mr. Frank Novello?""

Answer:","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

The context provided includes a reference to ""Vincent Novello, Organist to the Portuguese Embassy"" in the article ""A Periodical Collection of Sacred Music"" from 1828. Given that the surname of the person in question is ""Novello"" and the context suggests that this name is of Italian origin, it is reasonable to infer that ""Mr. Frank Novello"" is most likely of Italian descent as well. However, the given context suggests that he holds a position in the Portuguese Embassy, indicating that he is a citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during that time.

Therefore, the country of citizenship of Mr. Frank Novello is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M.

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Mr. Joseph Kaye?""

Answer:","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

Confidence: 90%

Explanation:

The context provided is a series of unrelated text snippets from a historical music magazine. None of the snippets directly mention the country of citizenship of Mr. Joseph Kaye. However, since one snippet mentions ""Oxford Street Chapel, another suburban centre of musical activity, was the /oca / e of a particularly good all - round performance of ‘The Creation’ under Mr. Joseph Kaye"", it can be inferred that Mr. Joseph Kaye might be residing in or near the Oxford Street area in London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Given that this is a historical text, it can be assumed that Mr. Joseph Kaye was a citizen of the UK during that time. 

Based on this analysis, and with 90% confidence, I conclude that the country of citizenship of Mr. Joseph Kaye was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.",NIL,person,Q145,,0,0,0,1,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

D ailleurs, quand il serait vrai que les passions ne peuvent que causer notre malheur, cette vérité serait plus funeste encore pour nous, que les passions mémes ; il faudrait nous prouver qu’il est possible de nous défaire ‘des passions ; il faudrait nous convaincre du moins, que le sage est a V’abri de ces maux.” \x0c 268 —_ “MOORE’S SACRED SONGS."", 'Last not least, Mr. Planché, who has proved the power of his ability in lyric and dramatic adaptation, was employed to fit the poem for the stage.

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Sauvage?""

Answer:","France

Confidence: 90%

Explanation:

The person in question is ""Sauvage."" The relevant context provided does not directly specify the country of citizenship for this person. However, the works mentioned in the context have French origins, and the name ""Sauvage"" is of French origin as well, which makes it highly likely that the person is of French citizenship. Additionally, the context mentions a collaboration between Sauvage and Dupin, which further supports the notion of a French connection, as Dupin is also a common French name. With 90% confidence, I infer that the country of citizenship for Sauvage is France.",NIL,person,NIL,,0,0,0,0,NIL,1,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

Question: ""What is the country of citizenship of Signora Cornega?""

Answer:","Italy

Reasoning: Based on the given context, Signora Cornega is mentioned in a review of a concert in England. However, there is no explicit information about her country of citizenship. The fact that she is referred to as ""Signora"" indicates an Italian origin, as ""Signora"" is an Italian title of respect for a woman, similar to ""Mrs."" in English. There is no other information to contradict this assumption, so the answer is Italy.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.09195402298850575,0.15384615384615385

In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking. Even'the first of our native singers have found it indispensable to cultivate the style. t Some years ago Mr, and Mrs, Lacy r reached the highest Vol. 4, page 308."", 'The great passport to public favour, and it is as sudden in its exaltation of the fame of singers as ilis great in power, is the King’s Theatre—this has been frequently the subject of remark, but this season has confirmed it more than. ever with regard to the effect upon the Benefit Concerts. We are. warranted. in saying that even where the most’ extensive personal connection has seemed to favour the artist’s right to public patronage, the concerts have failed from the absence or the opposition of the leading stars of the opera. Mr. Lindley, than whom there is not a finer artist in the world nor a man more meritorious from: long and-universal ser vices, had a room which scarcely paid his expences.

Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe.

Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre.

{'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p561': 'On Tuesday the 27th June, at a convocation holden in Durham, the Rev. W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man.

The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art! Grazioli (who must not be confounded with the composer of the same name, who died at Venice in 1820) .'}

Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters.

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred.

Signor Curioni, Porto, and. Pellegrini supported the ordinary routine of the opera with the. sustentation their solid qualities .', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p388': 'To sum up her attributes then—she has a fine sensibility and a just conception—an intonation seldom incorrect—execution perfected and regulated by profound science. Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be. Her recitativo parlante i is far above that of most performers, and we must repeat that her entire manner exhibits the force of sensibility, intellect, and science, in the use of organic powers generally speaking far below those possessed by singers of so high a class. .', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p367': '“6 J E céde A Ja tentation d’essayer un portrait musicale de Mademoiselle Pasta. On peut dire qu’il n’y eut jamais d’entreprise plus difficile; le langage musical est ingrat et insolite ; 4 chaque instant les mots vont me manquer ; et quand j’aurais le bonheur d’en trouver pour exprimer ma pensée, ils présenteraient un sens peu clair 4 esprit du lecteur. D/ailleurs il n’est peut-¢tre pas un dillettante qui n’ait sa phrase toute faite sur Mademoiselle Pasta, et qui ne soit mécontent de ne pas la retrouver ici; et dans Ja juste admiration que cette grande cantatrice inspire au public, le lecteur le plus bienveillant trouvera son portrait sans couleur, et mille fois au-dessous de ce qu’il attendait.”” ° If such are the difficulties which the biographer of Haydn, Mozart, and Rossini, anticipated—if he who appears to have passed the larger portion of his life in following and observing the great’ public singers of his age, feared to encounter them in attempting to describe this celebrated female, our dismay should be infinitely increased. For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.'}
