The poet’s untimely death left the work far from being completed; but the editor has since availed himself so effectually of the aid of all the great song-writers of the present day, (Moore only excepted, whose assistance, on account of his own undertakings, was out of the question,) that all the vaJuable Scottish melodies may now be considered as being provided with good and suitable poetry. We cannot give a more correct account of the poetical part of the work, than is contained in a brief statement in the preface to the present edition. ‘‘ The poetry in these volumes,” says the Editor, “‘ comprises the most select and complete collection of songs ever offered to the public; a very large portion of which were written, at the solicitation of the Editor, expressly for this work, by Robert Burns; and, after his lamented death, by Sir’ Walter Scott, Professor Smyth, and Joanna Baillie. The work is also graced with several of the elegant songs of Thomas Campbell, and Lord Byron; and it contains the best songs of the olden time, and of Ramsay, Hamilton; Thomson, Smollett, Skinner, Macneill, Hogg, Cunningham, and many others.” In so great and various a work, occasional failures in execution must necessarily have occurred, and might be pointed out; but they are as few and unimportant as eould possibly have been expected; and we therefore have no disposition to make them the subject of minute criticism.'}
