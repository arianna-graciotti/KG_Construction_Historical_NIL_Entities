While at Cambridge, his time seems to have been very evenly divided between his academical studies, music, and theology, in all of which he achieved considerable distinction, for he came out in the “ Senior Optimes” in 1847. He had been Conductor of the University Musical Society, and had developed a warm friendship with the Professor of Music, the late Dr.', 'On Tuesday the 27th June, at a convocation holden in Durham, the Rev. W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.', 'Many of his anthems are of real musical value; but it is as a composer of psalm-tunes that he will be best remembered hereafter. Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.']","Your task is to determine the date of birth of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p524': 'Many of his anthems are of real musical value; but it is as a composer of psalm-tunes that he will be best remembered hereafter. Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.'}

Answer:","1823-10-00T00:00:00Z

Note: The exact day and month are not provided in the context, but the year 1823 is inferred from the information that he matriculated at St. Katherine’s Hall, Cambridge, in October 1843, and typically students would be around 20 years old when entering university.

M. Fiirstenau is however an addition. ‘This gentleman has but lately arrived from Germany. His execution is brilliant, but his tone is thin. Indeed all the foreign performers are thrown back in comparison with our own Nicholson in this grand respect, The reader will perceive, by the copious extracts we have made, how interesting we deem Mr. James’ work to be.. But we are to assure the amateur of the flute, that far more of moment remains behind, for which we refer him to the book itself, which is a specimen of how much amusement and instruction may be combined by knowledge and zeal, for with writing as an art Mr. James is obee 9 cy \x0c 64 “JAMES ON THE FLUTE.'}

Answer:","1710-01-01T00:00:00Z

Note: The provided context does not contain the specific birth year of Steiner. However, based on the given information that he was a musician of the chamber in 1738, a reasonable assumption for his birth date is around 1710, as it is common for musicians to begin their professional careers in their late 20s or early 30s. Without more specific information, this is the best estimate.

They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p459': 'industry and talents of the Fedi and of Guiseppe Amadori, who were united by a firm friendship, not very common amongst liter ary men; with the rest of their brothers i in art. ‘They mutually ARTEAGA ON THE OPERA. 73 communicated their feelings, opinions, and observations, by which ‘means they were enabled to correct their own defects, improve the plan of musical education, and enlarge the boundaries of the science.

(Note: This is an incorrect answer based on the given context, as there is no birth date mentioned for Haranc. However, since the task specifies that the answer must be a date of birth in the specified format, and given no specific information about Haranc's birth date, this is a hypothetical response. The correct response would be that the birth date is unknown based on the provided information.) 

However, considering the strict rule of the task, a more appropriate and factual response would be:

unknown

But since this does not fit the required format, and the task must be strictly adhered to, I will provide a placeholder date that signifies the data is not available:

The author in his preface, compares Rossini with Napoleon. The anti-Rossinians have been rather severe upon this aneonymons work.'}

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to.

{'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p35': ""would be glad in the present dearth of tenors to pleton illustrate Scotch melodies, Mr. Horncastle The most successful of Mr. Horncastle, He is essentially a stage singer, and managers avail themselves of his undoubted talents, but he is a very impracticable man to deal with. Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough.

Moreover, Rossini, though he may never have read the e says of Lord Bacon, must be instinctively aware of what that great man asserted, with as much eloquence as truth, in regard to popularity: viz., that the multitude worship the rising rather than the se¢- ting sun. Next to Rossini ranks the composer of La Muette de Portici, and Fra Diavolo—creations that will live for ever—creations that place Auber among those, whom fame will not allow to be forgotten; but their greatness has been rather dimmed than lustred, by the subsequent productions of their author. In fact, Auber though a gifted is not a great man; he renders the interests of his art subservient to his own he thinks fast—writes carelessly— and grows rich—but effects little or nothing now, (though he seldom brings forward less than two-operas annually), towards the advancement of music asascience. Yet, let us be grateful for what he has ettected —enough in all conscience to smother censure ; let us snatch the seattered beauties that abound in his Gustave—his Bayaderehis Philtre--his Lestocq—his Ambassadrice—his Diamans de la Couronne—and above all, his Domino Noir—operas replete with elegance, though wanting in the uni¢y and connected design of his two great works, Meverbeer comes next, with his romantic and grotesque giganticisms, (in which the inexhaustible genius of Scribe, that polyglot among dramatists, shines almost as preeminently as his own)— Rovert /e Diable, Les Huguenots—leviathans, vast, terrible, mis-shapenwith their universe of scenic effect—their volcanic masses of sound—painfully exciting—fatiguing to the mind—marked by a feverish restlessness which gives no repose to the mind’s ear.

The performance of “Tannhduser” in an establishment devoted to the glorification of prime donne, and with a chorus more accustomed to Italian than German Opera, received as much justice as could be expected under the circumstances. Most. of the solo parts were cast to competent vocalists, and the scenery—with the exception of the “Hill of Venus,’ about as conventional a pantomime’ ‘ballet scene as can possibly be imagined—may fairly be praised throughout. We can scarcely believe that this will be a favourite opera with the singers; but if it should become a favourite with the public, there can be little doubt that it will be frequently. given, and vocalists will thus receive their first lesson in humility. Wagner may be a tyrant, but it must be remembered that composers have too long been ruled over by those who should be their loyal subjects; and if he teach them their real place in the artistic kingdom, we can readily forgive him for a little excess of zeal in carrying out so salutary a reform. We have already expressed our opinion upon Mr. Gye’s other production, Verdi's ‘‘ Aida,” a gaudy spectacle which, as it belongs to no recognized school, we may presume to be Egyptian. With such a heroine as Madame Patti, this work may form an occasional attraction next season, but we doubt whether it will be anxiously inquired for either by the subscribers or the public.

It was chiefly written in imitation of Scotch Melody, and the airs were generally pleasing. One trio, in which the Italian taste of the composer manifested itself, had great merit, At Drury-lane, Artaxerxes was revived, Madame Fearon taking the part of Mandane, and Shakespeare’s T. aming of the Shrew was given with much music, for the purpose of introducing Miss Ayton as Catharine. She sustained the character in a manner to add much‘to her reputation for ability asan actress. ‘Thus things have proceeded much in the old train; but it is singular, that while upon every occasion when the appearance of a new singer or any other cause compels a recurrence. to legitimate opera, Artaxerxes is resuscitated—it is singular that no further attempt should be made to try the taste of that public, which for more than half a century has run after this the single specimen of ‘the lyric drama we possess, by a sound and regular composition of the same species.

Soon after however he commenced his career as a eomposer for the stage, but these pursuits not being approved of by the church, he was but slightly encouraged, ‘and at length left his own country and repaired to Venice, where he produced “ G/i Amori di Giasone e ad’ Ifile,” an opera, which was still better received hy the Venetians VOL, Yt.

At length he revisited his own country, which,. become less severe in opinion with respect to compositions for the stage, received him with open arms, and he to display at once his gratitude and his deference, composed his new opera on a religious ubject—it was called “ Ii Trionfo della Pieta.” “Marazzoli was not only a great singer and composer, he was also celebrated as one of the finest harp players of his time, and he has left many brilliant compositions for that instrument.', 'The first, which originated with the greatest-harmonist that Italy has ever known, was principally: celebr rated for truth and exactitude in imitation, learned modulation, fine contrasts in the different parts, and simplicity and beauty of harmony. Superiority in his art, and the power of bending with facility tothe different tastes of the French and Italians, gained Corelli an immortal name throughout Europe, although the moderate number of compositions he has left recalls to our minds the maxim of Zeuxis—Di-_ pingo adagio perch¢ dipingo per tutti i secoli. Even Lulli owned himself his inferior, when instigated by base and unworthy jealousy, he used the favour in which he was held at the Court of — France to drive Corelli from: ‘that kingdom.

Mr. Lorenzo Daponte has t a very curious flourish in the books of the opera, in which he says: ‘ we sigh no more for Malibran!’ and an enormous puff for the Italian artists in general, making some comparisons which had been better let alone. He says that the company procured by him shall merit the gratitude of the public; that we must all learn Italian without delay; and that he has got a gentleman in the person of one Dr. Montresor, who wiil assist him in teach- ing us. Very well, if it must be so, anything to oblige him, and viva /a musica!

Soon after however he commenced his career as a eomposer for the stage, but these pursuits not being approved of by the church, he was but slightly encouraged, ‘and at length left his own country and repaired to Venice, where he produced “ G/i Amori di Giasone e ad’ Ifile,” an opera, which was still better received hy the Venetians VOL, Yt.

At length he revisited his own country, which,. become less severe in opinion with respect to compositions for the stage, received him with open arms, and he to display at once his gratitude and his deference, composed his new opera on a religious ubject—it was called “ Ii Trionfo della Pieta.” “Marazzoli was not only a great singer and composer, he was also celebrated as one of the finest harp players of his time, and he has left many brilliant compositions for that instrument.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p442': 'The first, which originated with the greatest-harmonist that Italy has ever known, was principally: celebr rated for truth and exactitude in imitation, learned modulation, fine contrasts in the different parts, and simplicity and beauty of harmony.

Mr. Lorenzo Daponte has t a very curious flourish in the books of the opera, in which he says: ‘ we sigh no more for Malibran!’ and an enormous puff for the Italian artists in general, making some comparisons which had been better let alone. He says that the company procured by him shall merit the gratitude of the public; that we must all learn Italian without delay; and that he has got a gentleman in the person of one Dr. Montresor, who wiil assist him in teach- ing us.

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'At the fourth concert, on the roth ult., a very good performance of Beethoven’s Choral Symphony was given, the principal vocal parts being carefully rendered by Madame Blanche Cole, Miss Enriquez, Mr. Henry Guy and Mr. Wadmore.

This grand work was noticed in our review columns exactly a twelvemonth since in such: detail that it is needless to repeat here the remarks made on that occasion; we shall, therefore, confine ourselves now to the performance. Of this, on the whole, we can speak very favourably. It would be untrue to say that the Crystal Palace Choir is, in general, at all on a par with its magnificent orchestra; but Handel’s music is so familiar in style to all English choristers, that the Te Deum jaboured under far less disadvantages than would one of Bach’s church Cantatas, or a choral work of the modern German school. The choruses were sung correctly throughout, but with a certain amount of coldness and want of spirit which prevented some of the finest numbers from realising their full effect. The solo parts were excellently given by Madame Blanche Cole, Madame Patey, Mr. Henry Guy, and Mr. Patey. The charming soprano air, ‘‘ When Thou tookest upon Thee,” which, in feeling, is curiously like the setting of the same words in the ‘Dettingen Te Deum,” produced a great effect, as also did Mr. Henry Guy’s singing of the “* Vouchsafe, O Lord.” As the original score of the work is unusually thin, even for Handel—nearly the whole of it being instrumented only for two violins, one oboe, basses, and organ—additional accompaniments were written by Mr. Ebenezer Prout for this performance. Mr. Prout has, throughout the whole Te Deum, retained Handel’s own score without a single note of alteration. One or two impracticable trumpet passages in “Day by day” have been transferred to. the clarinets, as Mendelssohn and Franz have done in their arrangements of Bach's music; but Handel’s text is nowhere changed; and the additions consist solely of.a richer instrumentation for some of the more jubilant movements, the completion of the string quartett by adding a viola part (the Duke of Chandos had no violas in his orchestra), and the filling up the harmonies indicated by the figured bass in the numerous cases in which, according to Handel’s custom, this forms the sole accompaniment to the voices. At the same concert a second novelty was Professor Oakeley’s brilliant and pleasing (though somewhat Mendelssohnian) “ Edinburgh March,” composed for the Liverpool Musical Festival of 1874, and heard on this occasion for the first time at the Crystal Palace, We must also mention the performance of Bach’s Suite in B minor, for. flute solo and stringed orchestra, at the concert on the Igth ult. This work consists of 2 number of movements, strung together without any positive connection, but so full of abstract beauty as to arrest the attention of the most impassive listener. The important flute part was exquisitely played by Mr. Alfred Wells, and it is needless to say how finely the stringed portion of the composition was rendered throughout. Mr. Manns deserves much credit for the introduction of this interesting composition."", 'We auticipated great things, but our anticipations fell short of the grateful reality; we foretold the gay and brilliant throng that would crowd the spacious hall, but yet we were unprepared for that dazling assemblage of beauty, elegance, and rank, that met our gaze on the evenings of Monday and Tuesday. Let not our readers accuse us of exaggeration. The scene that presented itself from the front of the orchestra was so imposing that the veteran Braham, albeit accustomed to similar sights, exclaimed that the hall, with its thousands of spectators, reminded him in its magnitude and splendour of the gorgeous descriptions in the tales of the Arabian Nights. Of the hall itself it is unnecessary to repeat what we have already said on the subjeet. We will only add, that from the judicious alterations which have been made with a due regard to sound and effect, it is now equal to any music hall in the kingdom, Jand when the idle objection to its name, which we have heard \x0c rumoured to exist, has faded away, the people of Manchester will be justly proud of possessing, at last, a public building suited to the wants and pulation of this great town. For we fully agree with a contemporary, that the accommodations both for sight and sound which were enjoyed on Monday and Tuesday, far excelled those of the last Manchester Festival at the church, and were more unexceptional than using the theatre.', 'On Thursday, Miss Hughes took her benefit, and a new opera called Nadir and Zuleika was produced ; the music _partly selected, partly composed by Mr. Horn. Of course, the piece is of an eastern character. The music is light, pretty, and well suited to the sentiment. The plot is rather extravagant ; turning upon no less than the opium day-dream of Nadir, a young gentleman who has expressed a wish to become acquainted with the lovely houris; or black-eyed beauties of Mahomet’s heaven; and this being overheard by Zuleika, a young lady who imagines that her charms are sufficient to ensure him a terrestrial paradise, she resents his conduct by dosing him and his servant with opium ; and then gets up a scene during his bewilderment, which causes him to believe, that he really has thrown off ‘ this mortal coil,’ and is in possession of his wish. A number of droll circumstances and situations arise, which we have not space to dwell on: suffice it to say, that it is a lively operetta of the Abon Hassan’ species ; and, like that piece, has an admirable part for Placie, which he makes the most of; indeed, he is extremely droll, and kept the house in constant laughter. The overture is composed by Fetis, a person who stands high as a critic in Paris, and editor of a musical journal. Mr. Horn has’ likewise used the chorus Tacete non temete, by Mercadante, as found in his opera Le Nonne de Gamache. It is also introduced in Elise e Claudio. To this he has added a second subject skilfully, and, we think, has increased its effect. A ballad, founded on a Swiss air, sung by Miss Hughes, is a charming little gem; and was executed by her extremely well, and deservingly encored. She had likewise a bravura, with a corno and clarinette accompaniment. The former instrument was clumsily managed, the latter had not enough to do; but Herwig never fails in his part; and what he had to play was perfect. We do not admire this bravura ; the divisions are common-place, and such as we have heard five hundred times with all the clap-traps and gallery-delights commonly used; but Horn has instrumented the song with his usual ability. Jones has two songs, both good ; the last a very beautiful air, tov chaste perhaps to please the multitude; but it comes in a bad situation, directly after the former noisy song.
