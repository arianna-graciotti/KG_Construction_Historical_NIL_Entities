A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.']","Your task is to determine the date of birth of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.'}

He afterwards received further instructions from Saratelli, the predecessor of Galuppi;, as Chapel Master of St. Mark at Venice.

A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p16': 'at SEPTEMBER rath, 13th, rath, and 15th, 1876.

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'The birth-place of Rossi, the composer next in ‘succession, is unknown; but it is most probable that he belonged tothe Roman school, as in 1580 he became master of the chapel at Loretto.', ""Gasparo.

{'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p250': 'The agreeable Morroni, educated in the Florentine school of Sborgi* and Guidi, is a distinguished composer, and his talent for singing is not less remarkable. He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p335': 'The birth-place of Rossi, the composer next in ‘succession, is unknown; but it is most probable that he belonged tothe Roman school, as in 1580 he became master of the chapel at Loretto.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p252': ""Gasparo.

Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.'}

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded.

Harper, who gave the double bass obbligato to Vincent Novello’s air, ‘‘ Thy mighty power,” (well sung by Miss Amy Aylward) with such a perfect command of his difficult instrument as to elicit the warmest applause, and amply to justify his position as “‘ Professors’ Scholar.” Amongst the vocalists, Miss Marian Williams, in Handel’s “Let the bright Seraphim ” (Trumpet obbligato, Mr. T.

{'TheMusicalTimes_1875-388.txt_p546': 'Miss AGNES ZIMMERMANN gave an evening concert at St. James’s Hall on the zgth April, which was attended by an audience evidently prepared to appreciate a programme The concerted pieces were Beethoven’s Sonata in A major, for ‘pianoforte and violoncello (Op. 69), a Sonata in A, for pianoforte and violin, the composition of the concert-giver, and Schubert’s Trio im B flat, for pianoforte, violin and violoncello (Op. gg). The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p126': 'We never heard Madame Dulcken play better ;—in the immensely difficult quintet of Spohr, especially, and in the picturesque sonata of Beethoven, she absolutely astouished her audience. The wind instruments were delicious ; the names of Ribas, Laza rus, Jarrett, and Baumann, were a sufficient guarantee for this. The quintet of Onslow, went to perfection. We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p469': 'Special praise must also be awarded to Miss Frances Thomas for her performance of the first movement of Mozart’s clarionet Concerto in E flat, to Miss Julia de Nolte (Professors’ Scholar) for her refined and thoroughly artistic rendering of Vieuxtemps’ Reverie in E flat, on the violin, and to Mr. A. Harper, who gave the double bass obbligato to Vincent Novello’s air, ‘‘ Thy mighty power,” (well sung by Miss Amy Aylward) with such a perfect command of his difficult instrument as to elicit the warmest applause, and amply to justify his position as “‘ Professors’ Scholar.” Amongst the vocalists, Miss Marian Williams, in Handel’s “Let the bright Seraphim ” (Trumpet obbligato, Mr. T. Harper), Miss Kate Brand, in Mozart’s ‘* Deh vieni,” Miss Agnes Larkcom, in ‘Casta diva,” and Mr. Wadmore, in a clever Recitative and Air by W.

Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe. But nevertheless we must confess that these praises seem to us exaggerated, when they speak of the positive effects her sing- ing produces. The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice? Elle n’en eut jamais d’autre qu’un coeur propre a sentir vivement les moindres nuances de passion, et une admiration passionnée et allant jusqu’au ridicule pour le beau idéal. A Trieste, un pauvre enfant de trois ans qui s’approche d’elle et qui demandait ’aum6ne pour sa mére aveugle, la fait fondre en larmes sur le port oii elle se -_promenait avec quelques amis; elle lui donne tout ce qu’elle avait. - Les amis qui étaient avec elle parlent de charité, se mettent 4 louer la bonté de son coeur, etc. . Quand elle a essuyé ses larmes: ‘ Je n’accepte point vos louanges, leur dit-elle. Cet enfant m’a demandé l’auméne-d’une maniére sublime. . J’ai-vu, en un clin d’ceil, tous les malheurs de sa mére, la misére de leur maison, le manque de vétemens, le froid qu’ils souffrent bien des fois. Je ‘serais une. grande actrice si dans occasion je pouvais trouver un geste exprimant le profond malheur avec cette vérité.’ ee oo S¢ Ce sont, je crois, des milliers d’observations de ce genre, dont Mademoi- Selle Pasta avait la conscience dés l’age de six ans, qu’élle se rappelle distinctement, et dont elle se sert 4 la scéne dans le besoin, qui tui valurent'son talent et lui ont servi-de modéle.” oe a a That such are the materials which great actors draw from nature may be corroborated by many instances. We shall relate one of Garrick in confirmation, which was told to the writer of this article by the friend who was with him at the time. Garrick walking with this gentleman through the streets of London, met a butcher’s boy carrying some meat in a tray on his head, and .. whistling as he went for want of thought.’ Garrick sprung upon him, seized him by the collar, and with the most vehement gesticulations exclaimed, “ You villain, have I not told you a thousand times not to do that?” Theboy’s features underwent an immediate change to consternation, and he-stammered out “ Indeed Sir I never saw you before.’ Garrick quitted his hold, said he was mistaken, and passed on. His friend scarcely less astonished than the poor boy, asked what this could possibly mean. ‘¢ Why,” said Garrick, ‘¢ I wished to see the effect of surprize and terror upon simple nature, and I"", '""Tsar «there is luck in all things” is a trath which all are ready to admit; and the freaks of the blind Goddess are constantly the subjects of our wonder and admiration. By the way, I have been told that she is not really blind, and that the bandage over her eyes was placed there by the “old ones,” only because ‘they found themselves unable to account rationally for so many of her whims and caprices.. But for my part, 1 cannot believe this, especially when I consider the extraordinary eminence to which she has raised some men, in spite of their shallow qualifications. Here, Sir, without going into general history, I might produce numerous examples of forgotten. poets and painters, whom Fortune, with her help-mates Fashion and Folly, made the idols of their day. But I have too much sense of propriety to shew my reading by trespassing so much on your valuable space, and therefore I shall content myself with glancing at the musicians; indeed it will be sufficient for my purpose if I select him whose name stands at the head of this letter. How common it is to hear Rossini called “ the child of Fore tune”—the spoiled child, according to some—“ the most lucky fellow” that ever put pen to music paper, and other epithets which shew the sensation produced by his brilliant and extraordinary career. Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt. It is no wonder, then, that his music is without just expression—that i is, without that \x0c 8 ROSSINI: agreement between the sound and the : sense which all cultiv ated.']","Your task is to determine the date of birth of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

Sensibility* and intellect are finely demonstrated, and the nicest shades of conceptiont are as audible as her encomiasts describe. But nevertheless we must confess that these praises seem to us exaggerated, when they speak of the positive effects her sing- ing produces. The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice? Elle n’en eut jamais d’autre qu’un coeur propre a sentir vivement les moindres nuances de passion, et une admiration passionnée et allant jusqu’au ridicule pour le beau idéal. A Trieste, un pauvre enfant de trois ans qui s’approche d’elle et qui demandait ’aum6ne pour sa mére aveugle, la fait fondre en larmes sur le port oii elle se -_promenait avec quelques amis; elle lui donne tout ce qu’elle avait. - Les amis qui étaient avec elle parlent de charité, se mettent 4 louer la bonté de son coeur, etc. . Quand elle a essuyé ses larmes: ‘ Je n’accepte point vos louanges, leur dit-elle. Cet enfant m’a demandé l’auméne-d’une maniére sublime. . J’ai-vu, en un clin d’ceil, tous les malheurs de sa mére, la misére de leur maison, le manque de vétemens, le froid qu’ils souffrent bien des fois. Je ‘serais une. grande actrice si dans occasion je pouvais trouver un geste exprimant le profond malheur avec cette vérité.’ ee oo S¢ Ce sont, je crois, des milliers d’observations de ce genre, dont Mademoi- Selle Pasta avait la conscience dés l’age de six ans, qu’élle se rappelle distinctement, et dont elle se sert 4 la scéne dans le besoin, qui tui valurent'son talent et lui ont servi-de modéle.” oe a a That such are the materials which great actors draw from nature may be corroborated by many instances. We shall relate one of Garrick in confirmation, which was told to the writer of this article by the friend who was with him at the time. Garrick walking with this gentleman through the streets of London, met a butcher’s boy carrying some meat in a tray on his head, and .. whistling as he went for want of thought.’ Garrick sprung upon him, seized him by the collar, and with the most vehement gesticulations exclaimed, “ You villain, have I not told you a thousand times not to do that?” Theboy’s features underwent an immediate change to consternation, and he-stammered out “ Indeed Sir I never saw you before.’ Garrick quitted his hold, said he was mistaken, and passed on. His friend scarcely less astonished than the poor boy, asked what this could possibly mean. ‘¢ Why,” said Garrick, ‘¢ I wished to see the effect of surprize and terror upon simple nature, and I"", 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p144': '""Tsar «there is luck in all things” is a trath which all are ready to admit; and the freaks of the blind Goddess are constantly the subjects of our wonder and admiration. By the way, I have been told that she is not really blind, and that the bandage over her eyes was placed there by the “old ones,” only because ‘they found themselves unable to account rationally for so many of her whims and caprices.. But for my part, 1 cannot believe this, especially when I consider the extraordinary eminence to which she has raised some men, in spite of their shallow qualifications. Here, Sir, without going into general history, I might produce numerous examples of forgotten. poets and painters, whom Fortune, with her help-mates Fashion and Folly, made the idols of their day. But I have too much sense of propriety to shew my reading by trespassing so much on your valuable space, and therefore I shall content myself with glancing at the musicians; indeed it will be sufficient for my purpose if I select him whose name stands at the head of this letter. How common it is to hear Rossini called “ the child of Fore tune”—the spoiled child, according to some—“ the most lucky fellow” that ever put pen to music paper, and other epithets which shew the sensation produced by his brilliant and extraordinary career. Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt. It is no wonder, then, that his music is without just expression—that i is, without that \x0c 8 ROSSINI: agreement between the sound and the : sense which all cultiv ated.'}

Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm. Cramer as leader of the Opera band, an office that he did not long retain, for in 1798 the susceptible feelings of this admirable artist were destined to expede piano, a work in which she progressively conducts her pupils from the simplest to the greatest difficulties, is well known to the public.'}

Looking however, at the subject of Franz’s Opera and the dramatic action it indicates, we begin to doubt whether the absence of the latter, as in the present case, would not, in some parts at least, be rather an advantage to the music than otherwise.

He possessed as much fertility as novelty of ideas, and whilst a crowd of composers were at this period striving eagerly to outvie each other in all that was brilliant and energetic in their art, i€ was astonishing to see Galuppi surpassing them all in what the public likes best, novelty. Many authors of all kinds have manifested in their lives a very different character to that displayed in their writings. Moliere, so.gay, so infinitely amusing iri his comedies, was silent, and his. manners might have seemed more Suitable to a tragic poet; he possessed neither mirth nor pleasantry, Galuppi, however, was in his own character every thing that he seemed in his compositions, that is to say, he was full of vivacity, always cheerful, and always agreeable. Although possessed of a noble and commanding countenance, he maintained this sociable humour to a very advanced age. He had passed his sixtieth year when he was called to St. Petersburgh, on the faith of his reputation, and he there justificd all that had been said of him. At this age he preserved the same fire with which his compositions had shone in his youththey displayed all his early energy.

One of these was represented by a magic ring, which comes into possession of Merode a trooper under Tilly.

Endowed with the richest and most brilliant imagination, it is less b purity of style than by originality that this composer has succeeded in establish» ing his-universal and well merited reputation. He possessed as much fertility as novelty of ideas, and whilst a crowd of composers were at this period striving eagerly to outvie each other in all that was brilliant and energetic in their art, i€ was astonishing to see Galuppi surpassing them all in what the public likes best, novelty. Many authors of all kinds have manifested in their lives a very different character to that displayed in their writings. Moliere, so.gay, so infinitely amusing iri his comedies, was silent, and his. manners might have seemed more Suitable to a tragic poet; he possessed neither mirth nor pleasantry, Galuppi, however, was in his own character every thing that he seemed in his compositions, that is to say, he was full of vivacity, always cheerful, and always agreeable. Although possessed of a noble and commanding countenance, he maintained this sociable humour to a very advanced age. He had passed his sixtieth year when he was called to St. Petersburgh, on the faith of his reputation, and he there justificd all that had been said of him. At this age he preserved the same fire with which his compositions had shone in his youththey displayed all his early energy. On. his arrival in Russia he composed’ “* Didon,” and when he quitted it, *<Iphigenie en Tauride,’ which operas.', 'DwightSJournalOfMusic_1873-016.txt_p188': 'old music-master, It wasin the autumn of 1860, when Mme. Schumann was giving concerts there in Dresden with Joachim, the great. violinist. With the latter we had heen introduced one evening into a genial circle of musicians, after which, we find it jotted down as follows: We go out into the moonlight, and, turning some dark eorners—my companion lealing—enter one of thase smoke holes, swarming with beer-drinking life and laughter, distributed about in which,, according to affinities, you mag find the larger part of the intellectual, as well ag the duller male population, on any evening, in every city of Germany. The object is to find an old man who is aupposell ta “‘Kkreip” here, and who, in his wav, is quite a character, And presently thee rose through the ciger smoke, in the further corner, the white head of a tall and rather courtly personage.—high intellectual forehead, strong profile—a face combining eeverity with companionable humor and a spice of drollery even—who greeted us very cordially, and entered eagerly into talk shout America, andabout the musical signs of the times, the old schoo! and the new, &c. Plainiv an oracle amongst his younger con-sodules in that corner, most of whom appeared ta be musical. This was father Wieck, fend of having his own way evidently, hut. genial, witty, and prond (as he might be) ef his daughters, Clara Schumann and the Fraulein Malie. He knows well what is good in music; is a sharp, true critic. and is still, as he long has been, one of the very best teachers of the piano living, Prnees seck his tuition for their daughters, and pay him princely prices ; and that hismethod is a good one, he has at lenat two notable examples in his awn family to show. He isa thinker and not a mere man of routine; and he carries himself not only with dignity, but with the freshness of vouth stiil; good for cenviviality and good for work. The old man and our strong young violinist were evidently on the best of terms together. It was pleasant to see them: and +ait was ta sre with what a mixture of admiring affection and respect the young men would address their questions sand remarks to the “Herr Concertmeister,” as Joachim is styled at the cou rt of Hanover, where he controla the music upon terms worthy of the indepen‘lent spirit of an artist, and does not have to drudge in royal church and theatre like the Kapellmeisters of Dresden and most German courts, Again, a few evenings later: The concert over, now imagine a very pleasant, sociable symposium in an upper room of this same nice Hotel de Saxe.

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p126': 'We never heard Madame Dulcken play better ;—in the immensely difficult quintet of Spohr, especially, and in the picturesque sonata of Beethoven, she absolutely astouished her audience. The wind instruments were delicious ; the names of Ribas, Laza rus, Jarrett, and Baumann, were a sufficient guarantee for this. The quintet of Onslow, went to perfection. We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p771': 'eethoven’s trio in G major, for piano, violin, and violoncello, excellently played by Madame Norman-Neruda, Mr. Charles Hallé, and Monsieur Vieuxtemps, and a violin solo, a Fantasia on Der Freischiitz, by Madame Norman Neruda, accompanied by Mr. Hallé, were features in the programme. A new part-song, composed by Mr. Alfred R. Gaul, of Birmingham, “ The Silent Land,” was well sung by the choir. Mr. Charlies Halié played a pianoforte solo—Nocturne in D flat, and “Wanderer’s Song” (Chopin), and a “Hunting Piece” (Rheinberger), so brilliantly that an encore was elicited. Madlle.'}
