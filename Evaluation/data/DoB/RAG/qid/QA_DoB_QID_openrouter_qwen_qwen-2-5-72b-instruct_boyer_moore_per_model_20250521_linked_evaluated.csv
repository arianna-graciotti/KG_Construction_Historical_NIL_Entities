Answer:","The sentence provided does not contain any information about the date of birth of Mademoiselle Bonini. Therefore, I cannot provide a date of birth based on the given input. However, since the instruction specifies that the answer must consist solely of a date of birth and should not include any additional text, I will not be able to comply without additional information. If you have a specific date or another sentence that includes this detail, please provide it. 

Since no birth date can be extracted, I'll leave the answer space blank as per the format requested:
