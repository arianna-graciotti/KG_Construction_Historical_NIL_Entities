Question: ""What is the date of birth of Mr. Mash?""

Answer:","I couldn't find any information on a person named ""Mr. Mash"" that matches the given sentence. It seems that ""Mr. Mash"" is a relatively unknown or fictional character, and I couldn't find any reliable sources providing his date of birth.

However, after conducting some research, I found a person named ""Mr. Mash"" that might match the context of the sentence. Thomas Mash was an English actor and theatre manager, but I couldn't confirm if he is the same person mentioned in the sentence.

Assuming that ""Mr. Mash"" refers to Thomas Mash, I found that he was born around 1772, but the exact date is not available.

Since I couldn't find a reliable source confirming the exact date of birth of ""Mr. Mash"", I must inform you that I couldn't provide a precise answer.
