Who could discover the country of Scarlatti, Vinci, Pergolesi, Leo, Durante, and Caraffa, after hearing the trash which is now performed? Who could dare (without offending these immortal spirits) to praise these frivolous trifles, which now succeed to the grand and religious style of the ancient church music?

The name of Della Viola is almost equally great in sacred music as in profane, having given the highest eclat to the pontificate of Paul the Third. oo Alessandro Romano, : so named from being born in the city of Rome, was very much celebrated for. his surprising talent on the violin, and was admitted, whilst very young, into the Pope’s chapel: he did not however confine himself solely to this branchof his art, but soon. after commenced his career as a composer, . and struck out for-himself a style as original as it was learned and majestic. .He composed chants for four and five. voices, which | combine at thesame time the greatest richness of harmony with the most exquisite purity and. sweetness of melody. Romano continued long in the Pope’s chapel, adding lustre, by the suavity and beauty. of his music, to the pomp of his religion, in those magni-_ficent ceremonies with which the Capital of Christianity loves to honour it. At length, after having merited much from his country, seduced by that religion, the power of which he had so greatly ‘contributed to extend, Alessandro became a monk, taking the name of Julius Cesar, a name suiting a conqueror much better than a humble servant of God.', 'infants and young persons from different parts of Italy, whom disease or accident has qualified. The direction is committed to Sgatelli, the most celebrated of the Roman musici. The orchestras also are evidently on the decline. ‘The churches are impoverished, and can no longer be at so much expence for music as formerly.. The productions. for the theatre are rare, and often imper fect; the art no longer finds protectors amongst the great, who ought to encourage artists. Thus many parents -have not the courage nor indeed the inclination to forward their children in its exercise, The middle classes ‘likewise furnish a large number of instrumentalists, but the greater part content themselves with aspiring to a happy mediocrity.

It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal. It thus appears that the Duke increased the strength of his choir, not by engaging new members, but by obtaining the assistance of the King’s choristers.', 'People are apt to quote “ the German school” as authority in these cases.

In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals.

Several times I have thought of troubling you with an article on this subject, pointing out what I should conceive some improvement in the service: I have even had the temerity to think of recommending the non-performance of some of the very old dry services and anthems (my sacrilegeous thoughts do not extend to productions by Gibbons or Purcell)—but I do say, that to people who have any ear for music, and who are in the habit of attending the different cathedrals, it must be tiresome in the extreme, especially if they are not profound contrapuntists, to hear the changes rung upon a certain set of Te Deums and. Anthems, dull enough in themselves, but rendered intolerably so by diurnal repetition. I must however notice, that at the Chapel Royal some chants of Mr. S. Wesley’s have lately been. intro= duced, that are delightful for sound harmony and originality, and that- Mr, Attwood has had performed some new commandments of his, which do the highest credit to his. judgment and science ; the construction of them is quite novel for this part of the service.

To her influence, next to that of my art, do I owe the blessing of not having terminated my existence by suicide. Live morally, and love one another.']","The context provided does not include any information directly linking the person named ""Tam"" to a specific family name. The repeated text snippets appear to be from a will or a letter and mention a brother named Carl but do not provide any surname for ""Tam."" Therefore, based on the given information, there's no way to determine the family name of Tam.

However, adhering to the instruction to provide only the family name in the answer, I cannot give an answer here as there is insufficient information to identify a family name. If this were a real task, I would need to clarify with the requester that the context provided is not sufficient to answer the question. 

Since a response is required, and given the format of the example, the correct answer is:
