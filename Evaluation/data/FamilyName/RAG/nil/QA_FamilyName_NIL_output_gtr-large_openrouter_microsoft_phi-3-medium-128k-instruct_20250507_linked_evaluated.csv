Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.', 'On Tuesday the 27th June, at a convocation holden in Durham, the Rev. W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.']",Garrett,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8617021276595744,0.826530612244898,0.84375

They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'Catalani and the entire strength of the foreign corps vocale was mustered, and Rossini himself sung.

The syllable ‘wand’. was represented by the Pyramus and Thisbe wall-scene from the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ;’ for ‘haus’ Charlotte (Mrs. Moscheles) acted a scene she had written herself, in which she is discovered knitting a blue stocking, and soliloquizing on the foibles of female authoresses, advising them to attend to their domestic duties.', 'until he arrives at the. pause near the end, when he introduces a cadencé, which is assuredly a satire on his good taste.

It might with justice have been termed a‘fantasia, because this title implies few restrictions upon the imagination of the composer, we will allow it therefore to be only a mistake in terms; for when we look at the invention and construction of the whole piece, we are almost led to confess it matters little what such a splendid exhibition of the united efforts of mind and industry be denominated.']",Shakespeare,Shakspere,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8617021276595744,0.826530612244898,0.84375

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""]",Wilson,NIL,person,Q1645480,Q1645480,1,1,0,0,NIL,0,0.8617021276595744,0.826530612244898,0.84375

The abundant means s command are never squandered upon outward o show, but judiciously spent on a well-regulated, comfortable household.” We are permitted a glimpse of this happy family in the sanctum of home—almost the last glimpse before the shadow of death falls over all. It was Mendelssohn’s birthday, and his friends combined to keep it with due festivity. Moscheles must describe the revels :—‘‘ The proceedings were opened wifh a capital comic scene between two ladies’ maids, acted, in the Frankfort dialect, by Cécile (Madame Mendelssohn) andher sister. Then came a Charade on the word ‘ Gewandhaus,’ Joachim, adorned with a fantastic wig, @ la Paganini, played a hare-brained Impromptu on the G string. The syllable ‘wand’. was represented by the Pyramus and Thisbe wall-scene from the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ;’ for ‘haus’ Charlotte (Mrs. Moscheles) acted a scene she had written herself, in which she is discovered knitting a blue stocking, and soliloquizing on the foibles of female authoresses, advising them to attend to their domestic duties.', ""fugued choruses, “‘ In the voice of praise ” and “ Put thy trust in God.” 7. ‘* My song shall be alway.”—This is the first of the four-part anthems, containing, in the choruses, two tenor parts instead of one. The first tenor part in all these later anthems lies high, and rather corresponds to a male alto part than to an ordinary tenor; indeed, in some cases, Handel has written the part in the alto clef. In the present work, more than in any other of these anthems, the composer used old material. The subject of the opening symphony is borrowed from the Ode for Queen Anne's Birthday, and the movement in the form in which we find it here is identical with the first movement of the third oboe concerto. The. commencement of the first chorus is taken from the Passion of Christ, and the phrase, ‘‘The heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works,” is nothing more than “the heavens and all the powers therein,” of the Utrecht “Te Deum.” The subject of the last chorus is also taken from the same work. The finest part of this anthem is the choral writing. The second chorus, “ Righteousness and equity,” is the best number, and seems to have furnished the composer with some suggestions for the chorus, ‘‘ Thou hast prevented him,” in the Coronation anthem, “ The king shall rejoice.” Excepting the trio, “‘Thou rulest the raging of the sea,” the solo pieces are not in Handel's best manner; and, on the whole, this will hardly be considered one of the finest anthems of the series."", 'able feeling. Sir Walter Scott appears in his usual energy and vigour. His ‘“ Maid of Isla” is a sweet and beautiful song. His “‘ Donald Caird” is the very perfection of humorous description; and his ‘t Pibroch of Dhonuil Dhu” is, perhaps, one of the most inspiring warcries that ever was uttered. "" The symphonies and accompaniments to the melodies owe their birth to the greatest masters that Germany can boast. At the commencement of the undertaking, the editor, as appears from his correspondence with Burns, engaged Pleyel, then in the zenith of his fame, to compose them; a task which devolved on Kozeluch to continue, when Mr. Thomson had the good fortune, or rather the judgment, to put the work into the hands of Haydn, by whom a great portion of it was executed. On the death of that iNustrious man, Beethoven -contributed largely to it; and latterly, we observe the names of the highly-gifted Weber, and of Hummel, which appear, for the first time, in this new edition. In the use that he has made of the talents of these distinguished persons, the editor. has by no means been parsimonious; for the same airs have appeared, in successive editions, clothed in totally different garbs—the least successful having been displaced to make way for superior arrangements ; and the different styles of the composers give the work a variety and spirit which no single individual could have imparted to it.']",Althau,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8617021276595744,0.826530612244898,0.84375

(Editor of Harmonicon.)', '‘Tue base voice, whose powerful accents, combined with such tender and pathetic expression, produce at present such a wonderful effect, was little used in the serious Italian opera at the beginning of this century, and is almost unknown in the dramatic compositions of the-early Italian school. Tito, Idomeneo, and Orazio were written for tenor voices, contrary to ali reason and to the received rules of good taste*. The part of the High Priest in Gli Orazi was the first in which a base voice became conspicuous, sustaining so beautifully the trio in Eb; but even this was added by Cimarosa long after the first production of his opera, the trio being originally only a duet. It should seem as if the composer had not dared to avail himself of a quality of voice, in the more dignified characters of tragedy, which had hitherto been entirely appropriated to the buffo parts, such as Don Gruffo, &c. It must, however, be considered as the first triumph of the base voice, which has since run so glorious a career supported by such champions as Pellegrini, Galli, Lablache, and Tamburini.

His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value. He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

His: works were highly esteemed, though they consisted only of motetts written for the chapels of which he _was maestro, and which were St. John the Lateran, and latterly Santa Maria Maggiore, where he terminated his career.', 'possesses distinguished manners. Bandonelli, equally celebrated as a’ poet and as.a composer, isthe pupil of P. Teofilo, ‘who has acquired s so great a reputation by his religious compositions, and who was of the school of Clari and Sacchini. In vocal music and poetic expression he formed himself after Zingarelli. We regard Bandonelli as possessing a decided genius for poetry and a fine talent for music. His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value. He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author. If Ban‘donelli were as original, and rich in invention as he is happy in the choice of his melodies, he would acquire an immortal title to celebrity. The Preghiere a Dio; for three voices, are the most \x0c ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF MUSIC IN ROME. 33 beautiful of his works; they were published at Naples. Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

All the world takes a part in this contest: the profession side with Mozart, the diletianti, literati and editors of journals, with Rossini, and seek to gain over the many to their opinion. In this the latter party has immensely the advantage, for the press is open to them to make their daily proselytes. The journals generally contain some article upon this subject ; the journa!s are in fashion, and therefore their upiniuns are daily, nay hourly, obtrudel upon the public ; hence hundreds are heard conversing and disputing on this subject, who have never in their lives heard a note either of Mozart or Rossini.

There is a festal character about Mr. Léhr’s composition which certainly justifies its title, and we can imagine that it would be much more effective in its grand orchestral dress than in the plain costume to which, by necessity, it must be reduced for presentation in adrawing-room. The opening subject is bold, and the Trio is melodious, and none the worse for a few reminiscences of Mendelssohn, especially that from the ‘Wedding March” in the twenty-third bar of page 4.', '7 posers of this class adhered to the principle of unity as much as possible—they sought the brilliant and the beautiful for present effect—for effect upon the sense, and through the sense upon the fancy, thus creating scarcely more than physical excitement and its usual concomitants.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'The Red Cross March. 3.

What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'logue under No. 126, which begins, if my memory fail me not, with the words: AA! mon frere, je fen supplie, &e.

It seemed to me as though it were not the same work, on the occasion of its last performance at the Opera Comique, and that the frequenters of this theatre do not understand Cherubini; no one, now-adays, possesses the tradition, so to speak of his powertul and passionate music: among the actors there is no fit talent for the principal parts of this opera; again, the plavgoers, especially those of the Opera Comique, know nothing of the art, but those phrases which are familiar to them, and comprehend nothing which they are not accustomed to. The greater part of the revivals which I have witnessed, have been from this cause, outrages on the memory of their cuthor.', 'not merit belief, it is certain that Pergolesi. was much envied, and he seems to have proved in his own person that severe and incomprehensible sentence, which, says a French poet, nature in creating great men has pronounced against thein, Sois grand homme, et sois malneureux.” Vol. 5, page 45.

Sainton, Amor, Burnett, Pettitt, and White (violins, viola, violoncello, and contra-basso); that Miss Jessie Jones and Mr. Cummings were the solo vocalists, and that a selection of part-music was given by a group of female students of the Royal Academy of Music, it will be seen that, with the modesty of a true artist, Mr. Macfarren did not place himself in undue _prominence before his supporters. Asa composer he was “well represented on the occasion. His “ Suite de Piéces,” already most favourably mentioned in our reviewing columns, and the Second Sonata for pianoforte and violin, which we hope shortly to notice at length, were exceedingly well rendered and warmly applauded, the valuable services of M. Sainton being secured for the latter work. The programme also included Mozart’s Trio in E flat, for piano‘forte, clarionet, and viola, Mendelssohn’s pianoforte Duet “*¢ Allegro Brillante” (Op. 92), in which Miss Kate Steel ably assisted her master, and Sterndale Bennett’s Sestet in F sharp minor, which with the concert giver at the pianoforte, and the stringed instruments in the hands of the artists already named, it is needless to say, went to perfection.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""]",Morgan,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8617021276595744,0.826530612244898,0.84375

Moreover, Rossini, though he may never have read the e says of Lord Bacon, must be instinctively aware of what that great man asserted, with as much eloquence as truth, in regard to popularity: viz., that the multitude worship the rising rather than the se¢- ting sun. Next to Rossini ranks the composer of La Muette de Portici, and Fra Diavolo—creations that will live for ever—creations that place Auber among those, whom fame will not allow to be forgotten; but their greatness has been rather dimmed than lustred, by the subsequent productions of their author.

At this critical juncture, Mr. C. Kemble, one of the proprietors of Covent Garden, had determined upon accompanying Sir George Smart ina tour through Germany—a tour which may well be termed a tour of inspection, because health, relaxation, and pleasure, were not perhaps so much the objects as the view these artists had to better their professional knowledge, by a personal acquaintance with the progress of the drama and of music in that country of philosophers. | - They therefore made every ‘possible enquiry, and left nothing unsought or unseen that. pertained to the subjects of their pursuit.

Perhaps immediately after Mendelssohn, Spohr may take his place as a living composer—though great mannerism and repeated imitations of himself, almost unfit him for a station among such a glorious company. The predominant feature of Spohr’s music is a voluptuous monotony—a luxury indeed, but a vicious one. Oratorio, opera, sinfonia, concerto, quartet, to Spohr are all alike—one and the same thing, with regard to style—no shadow of distinction in character or in the march of thought—like a tide which ever flows—never ebbs.

We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem.

We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem. It is gratifying to the artist and honourable to the patrons of art to know and feel that such are the laws by which the human heart is generally regulated. The affluence of the country is now moreover so much increased, and the love of the fine arts is become sO necessary a concomitant of education, that there is ample room for all competitors of real merit; at the same time it must be palpable that the strain which competion lays upon the faculties of artists allows little opportunity to any but talent of the very highest order. ‘These great names were not however the only attractions with which the excited activity of the managers sought to augment the general and improve their own interest in the King’s Theatre.', 'Good ! we recognize in these delicacies of hypercriticism English politeness and humour We are informed that the wrath of the worthy English journalist against ourselves arose from an article inserted in No. 26. of the Gazette in the month of June last, under the title of Physiognomy of the concert public in the various capitals of Europe, in which we related an incident that occurred to our celebrated (!!) violinist, Lafont, at the Duke of Wellington’s.
