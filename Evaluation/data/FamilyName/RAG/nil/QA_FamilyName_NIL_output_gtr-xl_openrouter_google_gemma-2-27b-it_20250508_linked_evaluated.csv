Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Though Mr. Patey neglected to favour us with admissions for his concert, which tuok place at the London Tavern, on Monday night, we cannot forbear recording the decided success which rewarded the efforts of this old and eminent member of the Academy.

The author says in his preface, that he has read, analysed, and collated the writings of more than twelve hundred authors in the course of collecting the materials for his own work; and, high as it is, this estimate is probably not at all an exaggerated one. ‘The minute details in which he has engaged relative to the most important parts in the history of the art, prove clearly that his information was extremely extensive, and that he must have read, and read attentively, not only all the ancient authors, but also the works of Guido D’Arezzo, Jean de Muris, Gafforio, Glaveau, Salina, Zarlini, and in fact all the great theoretical writers on music which so abounded in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. There is not one of these works which he has not appreciated at its just value, and critically considered in relation to its influence on the progress of the art; nor has he passed over a single discovery of any importance unrecorded. In the arrangemeut of his work the Abbé has adopted a chronological order, which has this disadvantage, that it obliges him to take each department piecemeal, and return frequently to the same subject; but it has also the a:lvantage of presenting to the reader at one view the progress which the art in general made during any given epoch. For the music of the ancients, Don Caffiaux has drawn most of his materials from Fabricius, and the memoirs of Buretti; but he felt also the obligation of reading in the original authors ail the passages he had occasion to quote, and he appears te have fulfilled that obligation conscientiously.']",Albu,NIL,person,Q14914655,Q14914655,1,1,0,0,NIL,0,0.8936170212765957,0.8571428571428571,0.875

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'Troup (Pianoforte),! Miss Elizabeth Connolly (Pianoforte) ; ius Amy E.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""]",Armstrong,NIL,person,Q13627772,Q13627772,1,1,0,0,NIL,0,0.8936170212765957,0.8571428571428571,0.875

Urb. Cathedralis Musice prefecto in lucem edite.” Philippo Nicoletti, who flourished at the sane time with the last-mentioned composer, published several madrigals, which were much admired by his ceuntrymen; also a great deal of church music, and he became chapel-master to one of the cathedrals of Rome.. | The next composer who claims our attention was one w ho con‘tributed greatly towards the. improvement of madrigals, a species of composition at that time much wanting the hand ofa skilful musician to carry it to perfection. Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', 'di piano-forte.

In this masterpiece, we find no conventional phrases, none of those cabalette, to which, at every instant, recourse is had by mediocre composers, to supply the absence of genius. From beginning to end it displays a masterly talent, which nothing can weary or exhaust.” Théatre Italien.—It might naturally have been expected ‘that the revival of the lively Italiana in Algeri, with the first appearance of Signora Pisaroni in that character, would have attracted. But no, the same solitude which has so long reigned within these walls, still continued to spread its gloom around. It was remarked, that the Pisaroni is too serious in the character, and yet in the air Pensa alla patria, she was very effective; it is an air well calculated to show off her unrivalled power of expression. Galli, for whom the part of the Turk was originally written, sung with spirit; but no other excellency can atone for the nasal defects in his voice, Poor Graziani did all she could for the part she has to perform ; the wags say she is quite at home in the finale, Sono come una cornacchia, che spennaia fa erd, era!

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Bennett, and Ferrari.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Mr. Liddle officiated as leader of the band, Mr. C.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Lenton, and C.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'with their story, but their breath, ex songs.

His feeling as an artist is completely shown by the care he bestows on the making-up of his characters. ‘There is no actor on the English stage who so utterly gives up his identity as this Italian vocalist. Take him in the first act of Belisario, and in Linda di Chamouni, or La Gazza Ladra, and you will find a difficulty in believing him to be the same Fornasari; you will look once more to your bill to see if you have not been mistaken. Strange to say, one of his detractors found occasion in the course of the season, to remark that he ‘‘ over-dressed” one of the characters! What could the artist think of this charge! Had he sacrificed his identity too much ? Had he been rather too good? Some have said, that he has not made a sensation equal to that which he made in Belisario at the beginning of the season. If this be true—what then! Belisario like Torquato Tasso, is one of those “ starring” operas that are simply made to bring forward the baritone singer, and no opera of the sort has been played since; but Fornasari has one through the ordinary routine. ‘Taking this into consideration, none can say with justice that his success in La Gazza Ladra and in Linda hos not been proportionably as great as in Belisario.', 'The scenery is excellent.

The part of the High Priest in Gli Orazi was the first in which a base voice became conspicuous, sustaining so beautifully the trio in Eb; but even this was added by Cimarosa long after the first production of his opera, the trio being originally only a duet. It should seem as if the composer had not dared to avail himself of a quality of voice, in the more dignified characters of tragedy, which had hitherto been entirely appropriated to the buffo parts, such as Don Gruffo, &c. It must, however, be considered as the first triumph of the base voice, which has since run so glorious a career supported by such champions as Pellegrini, Galli, Lablache, and Tamburini.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7.""]",Severn,NIL,person,Q37151795,Q37151795,1,1,0,0,NIL,0,0.8936170212765957,0.8571428571428571,0.875

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings.

His last attempts in opera have not been crowned with success. ‘The best singers of this chapel are the soprano, Sagatelli—the contralto, Pellegrini, and the tenor, Jodran, Amongst the bases none are particularly distinguished. 7 _Sagatelli must incontestably be placed in the first rank of the singers of the chapel. His vocal theory is. recognised by all connoisseurs as the best, and his instruction is much sought after in _Rome.. We have already said that he is the master of the orphans. He: ‘takes a particular interest in the young Soprani, who are .', 'infants and young persons from different parts of Italy, whom disease or accident has qualified. The direction is committed to Sgatelli, the most celebrated of the Roman musici. The orchestras also are evidently on the decline. ‘The churches are impoverished, and can no longer be at so much expence for music as formerly.. The productions. for the theatre are rare, and often imper fect; the art no longer finds protectors amongst the great, who ought to encourage artists. Thus many parents -have not the courage nor indeed the inclination to forward their children in its exercise, The middle classes ‘likewise furnish a large number of instrumentalists, but the greater part content themselves with aspiring to a happy mediocrity.

I allude to an association of talented men who should have it at heart to. ennoble and elevate an art now so degraded, and to appropriate to itself all that is really distinguished in it. Isolated as they are, their associations are but sudden, nor is it an equally ardent love for ihe art which animates them. Generally speaking, the course of events gives to the taste of a nation a direction that appears to carry it away with giant strides from \x0c ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF MUSIC IN ROME. 39 the perfection of art. We dare not, we cannot resist the crash of the unmeaning productions of our time; we are carried away ‘by it, and forget all that is essential, great, and sublime, which formerly developed so well a feeling for this art, excited a sentiment for the beautiful, and elevated all the faculties of the soul. We have heard here many of the chef d’ceuvres of Mozart, Haydn, and Cimarosa, and we have found that their beauties are no longer appreciated, The amateurs in singing are the most numerous. As they are the principal ornaments of Rome, in a ‘musical point of view, we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of naming the most distinguished.—The Marquis. Ceva, Count Bolognetti, M. M. Sardi, Cartoni, Fontana, Moncada (who is now singing with great success at. the Opera), Campagnoni, Giovanini, and Baratti, are remarkable for their voices, and for the excellent school whence they come. The number of ladies distinguished for their superior vocal talents is much larger. We shall confine ourselves to Messdms. Caradori, Pellegrini, the Duchess Lante (for whom Zingarelli composed his Jerusalem Delivered) the three sisters Feretti (who are also fine piano forte players), Messdms. Perugini, Agricola, Paolina, Martinelli (the pupil of Sagatelli), Grossi (who also plays very well on the violin and violoncello), Masi, Heser (well known in Germany and married to the Advocate Vera); and to conclude, Signora Marioni Schoenberger, who has left Rome some time, Upon examining the result obtained in favour of art by so great an assemblage of fine talent, and upon finding that there does not exist one single musical society even of secondary importance in this town, thus the individual merit of these amateurs, ‘however remarkable it may be in itself, loses much in. our eyes. It is true that some years back a musical society, of about thirty members, was formed under the direction of the young Marquis Muti Papagurri, an intelligent and talented scholar of old Guidi, and equally skilful as a violinist, pianiste, and vocal composer, but besides that the number was not sufficiently considerable, properly speaking this society has never been constituted, for the members met, only for the execution of some airs, duos, &c. on the invitation of the director.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'WincuesTEer.—The new organ for the College Chapel, built by Messrs.

Miss Isabel Weale, who has recently come into somewhat prominent notice in connection wi Mr. Barnby’s daily concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, sang iause for herrendering of the soprano air, “O that thou hearkened,” and her singing of “With verdure clad,’ in the second part, called forth a twice ated encore. In the contralto solo, “Love not the world,’ Miss Marion Severn was also hi successful. But the chief burden of the solo portion of the work falls upon the tenor and baritone. . whose reputation is increasing steadily and surely, sang the tenor airs with a skill and feeling which left nothing to be desired, and, especially in the one beginning “ How many hired servants of my father’s,” deeply impressed the audience. Mr. Bridge’s excellent baritone voice was shown te advantage in the airs, “ Trust in the Lord” and “For this my son.” The duets for tenor and bass, “ Father, I have sinned ’’ and. ‘‘ My son is yet alive,” and the quartet, “ The Lord is nigh,” were most effective, and elicited much a plause. The two principal choruses, ‘O that men wo praise the Lord” and “Thou, O Lord, art our Father,” were sung with vigour and precision, and also the chert &ccompanying the tenor air, “ Let us eat and drink.” The secon pat ‘was very brief, and consisted of a few sacred airs and anthems. A recitative and air, “The soft southern breeze,” from Barnby’s “ Rebekah,” was exquisitely sung by Mr. Stedman, and Mr. Vernon Linley gave “Is not His word like a fire,” from “Elijah,” and Gounod’s “ Nazareth,” with a power which time and experience will farther develop.', 'Miss Clara Novello —Mrs. Alfred Shaw Miss Rainforth—Mr. Braham—Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Bennett.

The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages.

Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre.

There are too many passing-notes. in the harmonizations of Bach; Mendelssohn’s, however, always show exquisite taste.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Miss Le Roy as harpist, and Mr. T. Jolley tor the pianoforte. Wilson on Monday night, cave. for the first time his ‘* Mary Queen of Scots,” which subject Templeton had selected for his opening lectures; and on Thursday evening the latter gave, for the first time, his “ Beauties of Burns,” which subject Mr. Wilson had pretty nearly exhausted seasons before. The two Scotch tenors have been rivals throughout life. Tney were conventicle clerks together in Edinburgh. Mr. Templeton was either a compositor or became connected in some way with the press. Mr. Wilson was a reader or corrector of the press, and in that capacity read or revised most of Sir Walter Scott’> works. Having fine voices, both somewhat late in life turned theatrical tenors, Wilson appearing at Covent-garden Theatre, and Templeton at Drurylane. The former, having a beautiful voice with out much science or style, gained a good position promptiy, although never regarded as a firstrate artist. Templeton made no way until the matchless Malibran awoke him into life in the “ Sonnambula.’? She Ialianized his Scotch style, animated his cold temperament, and he fairly took the town by storm. Subsequent studies in Puris under Bordogai, Balfe, and other masters, have improved him wonderfully, although he remains a very uncertain singer; and the distortion of his face whilst breathing forth melodious strains as a lover has been a great drawback on his reputation.', 'R.

Something indeed there is much deeper than this—something which no man better than Wagner knows must make its way.; but the process will be slowat least in England—for art must cease to be fashionable before its real value can be gauged, and Opera in this country has not yet become National. The truth cannot be disguised that the Teutonic element in the house had a marvellous effect in teaching the audience that “‘ Lohengrin ” was not to be judged by the ordinary standard; so when the usual round of applause was given for the favourite singers on their entrance and the boisterous marks of approbation burst forth after an effective morceau, a very decided “‘ hush ” convinced the astonished Opera habitués that the vocalists must be considered as secondary to the work they were interpreting, and that any congratulations to individual performers must be reserved for the fall of the curtain. Thus far then has Wagner influenced us for good; and whatever may be the ultimate fate of his works in England, there can be little doubt of the truth of his conviction that the composer has a higher mission than that of administering to the frivolous taste of a frivolous audience. “Lohengrin? must not be accepted as the latest emThere may beand probably is—as much difference between ‘‘ Lohengrin ” and the ‘“* Ring des Niebeliingen ” (which has not yet been heard), as there is between ‘Der Fliegende Hollander ” and Lohengrin.” Wagner’s books must be consulted by all who wish to trace the growth of the idea which has ruled his artistic life; but the result of his philosophy may be found in his Operas, and so progressively developed as to convince even those who disagree with him of the singleness of purpose with which he has worked. Some feeling of disappointment may be widely felt when we are told that the “‘ art work of the future’ is to be based upon mythical legends, and that consequently ‘ Lohengrin” ‘*the type of the sole, real classical subject,” and Elsa, ‘‘woman—woman, as not previously understood,” should be characters which never could have had any real existence; but those who would judge Wagner are bound to come into court with an unbiassed mind; and when we say that for five and twenty years the Opera now submitted to our notice has been gradually rising in public estimation; that it has been played to enthusiastic audiences not only in Germany, but at Bologna, Florence and in the United States, there can be little doubt that it contains within it an element of vitality which cannot fail to preserve it even in the most uncongenial atmosphere.', ""One great excuse remains for all this want of perfection. It is to be remembered, that the great composer is afflicted with an incurable disorder (deafness), which to powers like his must be a deprivation more acute and distressing than any one can possibly imagine. May not. this disturb a mind gifted with such extraordinary genius ? Age is stealing upon him, and every one must sée from daily experience, that age, unaccompanied by domestic happiness, seldom improves the temper, and now the homage of the world is divided as it were between himself and ” Von Weber.—More than this, Beethoven, we are told, reads of ‘the world, although he sees and hears but little of it; he finds no doubt, as a man of penetration and sense, that throughout civilized society superficial education, manners, and habits, are now generally a adopted by the “million ;” he finds from all the public accounts, . that noisy extravagance of execution and outTageous clamour i in musical performances, more frequently ensures 84 a, BEETHOVEN'S NEW SYMPHONY.

She has been with us but four months, and yet in that short period how,sgreat the sensation she has produced. Endowed by nature with faculties of the highest order, she has found at our theatre opportunities, denied her elsewhere, of trying her powers in the highest rank of characters; in a word, she has done justice to the music of Gluck, and has found a public to appreciate her talents, who have not been corrupted by the insipidity of modern Italian operas.” Her last performance was in Die Veséalin, for her own benefit. On entering she was hailed by peals of applause, which were redoubled at the close of her first grand air; but in the second act her triumph was still more complete. At the conclusion of her pathetic air, which she gave with a truth of expression altogether her own, handkerchiefs were seen waving from the boxes, and copies of verses were thrown upon the stage at her feet.']",Collier,NIL,person,Q16865687,Q16865687,1,1,0,0,NIL,0,0.8936170212765957,0.8571428571428571,0.875

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'and Mrs, Knyvett—and the second was, thatno consideration could make her consent so to tax a brother professor. The result was, that Mr. and Mrs. Knyvett’s concert wassupported by their friends, consisting principally of the subscribers to the Antient Concertbut the public were drawn off by the irresistible desire to hear Pasta and Velluti* together. Here however the artists had to complain of the unfair assumption of their previously announced nights—an encroachment which can be justified, as it was sup‘ported, only by power and by contempt of those rules of courtesy which have hitherto been and ought always to be observed between the professors of liberal art.', 'The great passport to public favour, and it is as sudden in its exaltation of the fame of singers as ilis great in power, is the King’s Theatre—this has been frequently the subject of remark, but this season has confirmed it more than. ever with regard to the effect upon the Benefit Concerts. We are. warranted. in saying that even where the most’ extensive personal connection has seemed to favour the artist’s right to public patronage, the concerts have failed from the absence or the opposition of the leading stars of the opera.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Miss Le Roy as harpist, and Mr. T. Jolley tor the pianoforte. Wilson on Monday night, cave. for the first time his ‘* Mary Queen of Scots,” which subject Templeton had selected for his opening lectures; and on Thursday evening the latter gave, for the first time, his “ Beauties of Burns,” which subject Mr. Wilson had pretty nearly exhausted seasons before. The two Scotch tenors have been rivals throughout life. Tney were conventicle clerks together in Edinburgh. Mr. Templeton was either a compositor or became connected in some way with the press. Mr. Wilson was a reader or corrector of the press, and in that capacity read or revised most of Sir Walter Scott’> works. Having fine voices, both somewhat late in life turned theatrical tenors, Wilson appearing at Covent-garden Theatre, and Templeton at Drurylane. The former, having a beautiful voice with out much science or style, gained a good position promptiy, although never regarded as a firstrate artist. Templeton made no way until the matchless Malibran awoke him into life in the “ Sonnambula.’? She Ialianized his Scotch style, animated his cold temperament, and he fairly took the town by storm. Subsequent studies in Puris under Bordogai, Balfe, and other masters, have improved him wonderfully, although he remains a very uncertain singer; and the distortion of his face whilst breathing forth melodious strains as a lover has been a great drawback on his reputation.', ""Mr. Neate played with great ability.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces. A hymn by Haydn, a quartet, a Salva Regina, of great power, by Danzi—an exquisite quartet and treble solo from Mozart—a prayer and choral motet, very learnedly put together by Schict, are all nearly equally re- \x0c 254 a . ° NOVELLO’S MOTETS. markable for solemnity and grandeur—a quartet and base solo from Winter are ina lighter but more captivating manner. A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand.

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.']",Ferrari,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8936170212765957,0.8571428571428571,0.875

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', ""The ninth concert, on the 26th June, was in every respect highly interesting, but the absence of any novelty renders any notice unnecessary, save that a good word should be said for Mrs. Bodda-Pyne's singing of Handel’s “ Lascia ch’io pianga,’’ though we may venture to express a doubt whether it is politic for a-soprano, after an active public life, to come forward as a contralto. At the tenth and last concert of the season, Madame Essipoff's rendering of Chopin’s pianoforte Concerto in E minor was an attractive feature in the programme, and we may also compliment the band (under the able direction of Mr. W.'G. Cusins) upon a very fine performance of Beethoven’s “ Eroica’”?

Miss Blair sang the treble solos with considerable taste, and was especially successful in her rendering of “I know that my Redeemer.” The choruses were generally well sung, the “ Hallelujah” and “ For unto us” being marked with great precision.

Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be. Her recitativo parlante i is far above that of most performers, and we must repeat that her entire manner exhibits the force of sensibility, intellect, and science, in the use of organic powers generally speaking far below those possessed by singers of so high a class. .', 'The author of Die Vestalin, was heard to declare, that this was the first time his conceptions of the character had been fully realized. At the second performance his enthusiasm was unbounded, and he exclaimed, ‘“‘ As a singer Mademoiselle Schechner has no equal upon earth !” The impression produced by this lady, is thus described in an article printed in the Journal of Professor Voss :— “‘ Yesterday evening, Mademoiselle Schechner terminated a series of performances with a degree of éclat, which, perhaps, no other singer ever experienced. The public enthusiasm redoubled at each representation, and it is but justice to acknowledge, that never was feeling better founded. Is it not surprising that a singer, whose mame was scarcely known here eighteen months ago, should have so suddenly raised herself to the first rank, and established her claim as the first dramatic singer of the day? She has been with us but four months, and yet in that short period how,sgreat the sensation she has produced. Endowed by nature with faculties of the highest order, she has found at our theatre opportunities, denied her elsewhere, of trying her powers in the highest rank of characters; in a word, she has done justice to the music of Gluck, and has found a public to appreciate her talents, who have not been corrupted by the insipidity of modern Italian operas.” Her last performance was in Die Veséalin, for her own benefit. On entering she was hailed by peals of applause, which were redoubled at the close of her first grand air; but in the second act her triumph was still more complete. At the conclusion of her pathetic air, which she gave with a truth of expression altogether her own, handkerchiefs were seen waving from the boxes, and copies of verses were thrown upon the stage at her feet.']",Bonini,NIL,person,Q37123326,Q37123326,1,1,0,0,NIL,0,0.8936170212765957,0.8571428571428571,0.875
