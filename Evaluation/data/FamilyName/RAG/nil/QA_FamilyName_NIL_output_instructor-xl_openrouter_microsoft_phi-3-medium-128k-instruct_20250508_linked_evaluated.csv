Her advances in art have been slow and regular, and the hold she takes of the public has ""been certain, because it has. proceeded in the very manner we have described.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country.

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', '15.

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose? Nevertheless, whatever be the exercise proposed, | am_ bold enough to offer myself as a candidate, and doubt not that I shall have a good chance of being blackballed as well as Mr. Flowers, the would be founder of the society.

The Canon in Diminution, named “ Elegie,’ which opens Book 2, is exceedingly interesting, but the best of the series is unquestionably the following one. This commences with a Capriccio in 2-4 time, “ All’ Ongaresse,” entirely given to the second performer. Then we have a Mazurka, in 3-4 time, for both players, and this is succeeded by a movement in which the subject of the opening ‘‘ Capriccio ” is written in the primo part, whilst the secondo has the ‘* Mazurka,” three bars of the former being equivalent to two bars of the latter. The cleverness displayed in this piece is beyond all praise, and we strongly recommend it as a study for young players. The next, “ All’ Antico,” a canon in augmentation, is well written, but scarcely perhaps so attractive as its companions. No. 11, ** Scherzo,” is a good canon in contrary motion, and the last of the series is rather given as a specimen of the manner in which musicians used to amuse themselves in the ‘“‘canonical” days, for the secondo may become the primo with equal effect.

The author knows the value of a good mofivo. and having created one, is too experienced and skilful a composer to lose sight of it, however he may impart variety to it by amplification and modulation. The cantabile episode he twice introduces (to which he gives the German name, Choral) is as unexfected as pleasing, and by its gentleness affords a seasonable, well-imagined relief, the predominant character of the divertimento being that of boldness and hilarity. Mr. Griffin, also, has in one or two instances slightly, but very pleasantly alluded to the old school ; a left-hand passage at page 8—one of those in which our forefathers used to delectate—comes like ‘ long-forgotten joys renewed,’ and makes us live in the days of Handel and of organs.']",Mengozzi,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8947368421052632,0.8673469387755102,0.8808290155440415

A melodious subject for the ‘‘ Pleni sunt cceli’ with an elegant triplet accompaniment for the violins succeeds, and leads with a half cadence on the dominant seventh to the ‘‘ Osanna.” This movement is not, as is generally the case, treated fugally ; with the exception of the ‘‘Cum sancto spiritu,” already noticed, there is no attempt at a fugue throughout the Mass. The present is a bright little chorus in eight parts, short exclamations of the word “ Osanna’ by divided trebles and altos being answered by similarly divided tenors and basses. The “ Benedictus” for soprano, alto, and tenor solos with chorus is a good specimen of a portion of the Mass in which Schubert was invariably successful. It is full of charming and flowing melody, and is certainly one of the best movements in the work. The “ Agnus Dei” is also of much excellence; the modulation at the bottom of p. 88 of the score, and the beautiful treatment of the word “ Miserere,” should be especially noticed.

A mere accident had induced him to cultivate his voice.

For two years he remained there, working stead: fastly from six to eight~hours every day, and takinz special care not to tire his voice. When he was twenty years of agean impresario offered him an engagement for Russia. For some time Campanini questioned the wisdom of interrupting his studies, but the temptation was too great, and he consequently made: his appearance in the smal] towns of Russia, Odessa, Karkoff, and Tiflis, as second tenor.

Campanini, as we have said, made his debut as second tenor, but was soon promoted to the dignity of first. He-remained some three yearsin Russia, sing ng at. night, and studying by day, with praiseworthy perseverance and energy. On leaving Russia, Campanini made his way to Milan, where he studied arduously under the celebrated Maestro Lamberti (who taught Mile. Alboni), reputed to be the first. professor of music in Italy.

During one of these tuneful fits, when Pietro was in his happiest mood, the cvlebrated lawyer and critic, Gravina, happened to pass by his father’s door, and was no less struck with the youth of the poet, than with the softness, yet brilliancy of his verse, the smoothness of his measure, and the sprightliness of his wit, whieh he employed, all’ improvvista, upon the people and objects that surrounded him. Drawing near, Gravina expressed his admiration, and offered him some money; the firm but polite refusal of his donation increased his admiration for the little bard, and he instantly formed the resolution of adopting him as his son.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'Evans, Mr. M‘Murdie, Mr. Nicks, Mr. Bates, Mr. Elliott, Mr. Brownsmith, Mr. Streete, Mr. Walmisley, Mr. Gedye, Mr. Spencer, Mr. Moxley, &.

 'In our opinion, Mr. White is the only private duet singer that the London Music Saloon has produced, and is equally appreciative to Mr. Philipson and Mr. Craven.""}

Answer: White

In the sentence provided, the name Mr. White appears along with several others. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that Mr. White is a singer and is appreciative of Mr. Philipson and Mr. Craven. Thus, his occupation is a singer. However, the family name (surname) of Mr. White is not explicitly stated. But since the context mentions him in relation to his profession, it can be deduced that the family name (surname) of Mr. White is 'White'.",NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8947368421052632,0.8673469387755102,0.8808290155440415

Bandonelli, equally celebrated as a’ poet and as.a composer, isthe pupil of P. Teofilo, ‘who has acquired s so great a reputation by his religious compositions, and who was of the school of Clari and Sacchini. In vocal music and poetic expression he formed himself after Zingarelli. We regard Bandonelli as possessing a decided genius for poetry and a fine talent for music. His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value. He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author. If Ban‘donelli were as original, and rich in invention as he is happy in the choice of his melodies, he would acquire an immortal title to celebrity. The Preghiere a Dio; for three voices, are the most \x0c ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF MUSIC IN ROME. 33 beautiful of his works; they were published at Naples. Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art! Grazioli (who must not be confounded with the composer of the same name, who died at Venice in 1820) .', 'The pupil of Porpora, and friend and contemporary of Jomelli, Piccini, Sacchini, Cimarosa, and Paisiello, he has studied the theory and practice of music deeply, as well as the literature of the art. It is to him we owe the most authentic information concerning the history of the music of his country.

Hawkins, “that the Messiah was first performed in 1741, and coldly received.” Mr. C. gives reasons which render it probable that it was not brought out till 1742, and that it was from the first highly estimated. Sir J. Hawkins however was a man of such determined accuracy, that he rarely if ever hazarded a fact but on good grounds. Wecanstateso much on the most certain authority. Upon tlie accompaniments of Mozart to the Messiah, Mr. Crosse has introduced some able and sound observations, and in: an admirable temper. Mr. Crosse also distinguishes Mr. Vaughan’s singing “‘ Thy rebuke,” and the succeeding air, with particular encomium. We have no hesitation not only in en- forcing the learned author’s-remark, but we fearlessly pronounce that his delivery of the former is the purest and most elevated example of impassioned recitative now to be heard. While Mr.', 'Many of his anthems are of real musical value; but it is as a composer of psalm-tunes that he will be best remembered hereafter. Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.']",Braun,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8947368421052632,0.8673469387755102,0.8808290155440415

Macfarren, in ~cone ofthis articles om the “Musie uof the, English « Chareh,” that the-singing of hymns ‘to the popular tunes of the day; “has heen‘ acted upon, With wanton extravagatico, reckless alike of all ‘effect and: of all.', ""Tus very interesting little work. is, to the best of our belief, new alike in idea and execution. Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'The pieces are a quartet and chorus from Haydn, a base solo and quartet from Himmel, a trio from Cherubini, a duet for tenor _..and base from a MS. of Naumann, a quartet from the Benedictus of Huminel’s first mass, a quartet and chorus of Andreas Romberg, a quartet, from a rare MS. of Bonelli, and a Tantum ergo and chorus by Mr: Novello. The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces. A hymn by Haydn, a quartet, a Salva Regina, of great power, by Danzi—an exquisite quartet and treble solo from Mozart—a prayer and choral motet, very learnedly put together by Schict, are all nearly equally re- \x0c 254 a . ° NOVELLO’S MOTETS. markable for solemnity and grandeur—a quartet and base solo from Winter are ina lighter but more captivating manner. A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand.

The first tenor part in all these later anthems lies high, and rather corresponds to a male alto part than to an ordinary tenor; indeed, in some cases, Handel has written the part in the alto clef. In the present work, more than in any other of these anthems, the composer used old material. The subject of the opening symphony is borrowed from the Ode for Queen Anne's Birthday, and the movement in the form in which we find it here is identical with the first movement of the third oboe concerto. The. commencement of the first chorus is taken from the Passion of Christ, and the phrase, ‘‘The heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works,” is nothing more than “the heavens and all the powers therein,” of the Utrecht “Te Deum.” The subject of the last chorus is also taken from the same work. The finest part of this anthem is the choral writing. The second chorus, “ Righteousness and equity,” is the best number, and seems to have furnished the composer with some suggestions for the chorus, ‘‘ Thou hast prevented him,” in the Coronation anthem, “ The king shall rejoice.” Excepting the trio, “‘Thou rulest the raging of the sea,” the solo pieces are not in Handel's best manner; and, on the whole, this will hardly be considered one of the finest anthems of the series."", ""Lord, whose mercies,” which was expressively given by Miss Julia Elton. From ‘“ Jephtha” waschosen the fine chorus, “ When His loud voice,” the recitative, “‘ Deeper and deeper still,” and air, “ Waft her angels,”—the union of which, to the detriment of the composer's original intention, seems now to have been sanctioned by custom,—and the air, “ Farewell, ye limpid springs,’’ preceded by the brief recitative, “‘ Ye sacred priests.” The first of these was given by Mr. Vernon Rigby with a depth of expression and purity of intonation which left nothing to be desired; and the beautiful soprano air was rendered to perfection by Madame Nouver, who, if we may judge from this specimen of her powers, is destined to become one of the very best of our Oratorio singers. The first part was brought to a close by the’chorus from ‘‘Joshua,” “ Glory to God,’ the solo well sung by Mr. Pearson, who also gave the recitative, *°Tis well,’ which was followed by the popular march."", 'The first part of the e@ was occupied by Sallivan’s Oratorio, ‘* The Prodigal Son 3” the soloists ing Misa Isabel Weale, Miss Marion Severn, Mr. Stedman, and Mr. F. A. Bridge, the last mentioned gentleman having genezously undertaken, at a moment’s notice, the part previously allotted to Mr. Thurley Beale, who was unavoidably prevented from appearing. Miss Isabel Weale, who has recently come into somewhat prominent notice in connection wi Mr. Barnby’s daily concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, sang iause for herrendering of the soprano air, “O that thou hearkened,” and her singing of “With verdure clad,’ in the second part, called forth a twice ated encore. In the contralto solo, “Love not the world,’ Miss Marion Severn was also hi successful. But the chief burden of the solo portion of the work falls upon the tenor and baritone. . whose reputation is increasing steadily and surely, sang the tenor airs with a skill and feeling which left nothing to be desired, and, especially in the one beginning “ How many hired servants of my father’s,” deeply impressed the audience. Mr. Bridge’s excellent baritone voice was shown te advantage in the airs, “ Trust in the Lord” and “For this my son.” The duets for tenor and bass, “ Father, I have sinned ’’ and. ‘‘ My son is yet alive,” and the quartet, “ The Lord is nigh,” were most effective, and elicited much a plause. The two principal choruses, ‘O that men wo praise the Lord” and “Thou, O Lord, art our Father,” were sung with vigour and precision, and also the chert &ccompanying the tenor air, “ Let us eat and drink.” The secon pat ‘was very brief, and consisted of a few sacred airs and anthems. A recitative and air, “The soft southern breeze,” from Barnby’s “ Rebekah,” was exquisitely sung by Mr. Stedman, and Mr. Vernon Linley gave “Is not His word like a fire,” from “Elijah,” and Gounod’s “ Nazareth,” with a power which time and experience will farther develop.']",Stevens,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8947368421052632,0.8673469387755102,0.8808290155440415

Throughout two pages lie keeps the air constantly before us, in passages of well-varied ex- pression, till after a smooth descent he suddenly forms an ingenious and effective. contrast by the introduction of the first phrase of tlie celebrated Bacchanalian song in G major, and (after having modulated into the original key of B minor,) he gives us the whole of it in all its wonted ferocity. Here Mr. Pixis has displayed much ability. He has worked up a@ movement upon it, in the style of a fugue, which demonstrates great energy and originality, besides being well adapted to its subject, and it is concluded by the tremando, with the passage for the drum, that forms so principal a feature throughout the opera. The lesson is finished by an allegretto, in 4 time, commencing with the waltz, and introducing alternately the other airs, which form the Melange, in’ a very ingenious and spirited manner. Here however Mr. Pixis has again succeeded best in his treatment of the Bacchanalian song, which, together with the opening, forms the chief.attr action of the lesson. In the second Melange the materials have been gathered from all parts of the opera, and are certainly strung together with great skill; yet it is neither so, connected, nor so well. calculated to please generally as the first. It commences with the chorus of spirits, at the opening of the incantation scene; to this is appended a passage, displaying great ability on the part of the composer, paving: the w ay for the introduction of one of those in-— describably: original and characteristic traits, on which the whole of Der Freyschuts turns, but of which we can give the reader no better explanation, as no definite place is ascribed to it in the opera. -On this Mr, P. has worked in the same effective manner as on the Bacchanalian song in the first Melange.

The Italian style may be almost said to be purely vocal—it is therefore a most difficult task to select such peculiarities as shall not be out of place when removed to-a piano forte levson, and yet shall be sufficiently characteristic to denote the soil from which they are transplanted ; in this Mr. Moscheles has succeeded most ably, particularly in the opening adagio, choosing only for his purpose such passages of delicacy and expression as cannot fail to please any where, and enriching those of mere brilliancy. The whole way through the adagio the right hand may be said to have the task assigned to it of executing the main subject of the fantasia, whilst the base, in Mr. M.’s own style, lends to it the solidity and ‘richness necessary to all such music.', 'The Glee, the Elf-King, “‘is partly founded on an Italian air,” says the composer. The air is that which is so popular in the ballet of Nina; but we wish that Mr. Hargreaves had not yielded to the practice of taking entire airs, then using the deceptive language, “ partly founded,” employed by many quacks of the present day ; it is beneath him. It must, however, be admitted that the solos he has introduced, in the manner of Dr. Callcott’s familiar glees, between the trio parts, are his own. The whole together produce a very pretty effect; but the second voice should be a soprano, not a tenor, as directed, for the latter is too remote from the melody, to produce that blending of the first and second parts which is required in compositions of this sort.']",Manvers,NIL,person,,,0,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.8947368421052632,0.8673469387755102,0.8808290155440415

This annual assemblage of the Yorkshire Amateurs has been honourably, though not quite correctly, noticed in some of the periodical musical reports. During the series of years that it has now existed, it has been the chief rallying point for the lovers of music in this extensive county, and almost the only opportunity which they enjoyed of. being brought together in harmonious contact. Its influence, therefore, when the union of hearts and the improvement of taste, which it has created and diffused, are considered, cannot but have been most beneficial, even on the greater festival of the year; and as all its members and supporters were interested also in the success of the latter attempt, a short account of their musical exertions will not be deemed wholly out of place in the present narrative.

The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice?

At this critical juncture, Mr. C. Kemble, one of the proprietors of Covent Garden, had determined upon accompanying Sir George Smart ina tour through Germany—a tour which may well be termed a tour of inspection, because health, relaxation, and pleasure, were not perhaps so much the objects as the view these artists had to better their professional knowledge, by a personal acquaintance with the progress of the drama and of music in that country of philosophers. | - They therefore made every ‘possible enquiry, and left nothing unsought or unseen that. pertained to the subjects of their pursuit. The first public result. appears to have been the engagement of Carl Maria Von Weber to support by his presence in England the reputation he had already gained. a ‘The piece he was to work upon was drawn from the poetical visions of one of the most inspired of his own countrymen, Wieland—the time, the proudest.age of chivalry.

In Erard’s: action there is a spring applied which exists in no other action for pianofortes.” By the kindness of the Great London firms he (Sir R. Stewart) was enabled to exhibit werking models of most of these actions of Hopkinson, Erard, and Broadwood, which were most ingenious examples of engineering on a minute scale. The grand pianos of Erard had been identified with the performances of Thalberge (now unfortunately deceased), and of Franz Liszt? who was still alive, but had of late years become an Abbé and given up [?] the world, living in retirement at Weimar. It was‘of Liszt and the Erard piano that Heine had thus spoken in the year 1842, “ He is here,” said the caustic Jew-poet, the “ Attila—the seourge of God to all Erard pianos: which tremble at the first news of his coming, and which now again shiver and bleed, and whimper under his hapa et it becomes a fair.case for the ‘society .for freventing cruelty to animals !’” . Yet, in spite of all the extravagance of his manner and his music, there was something inexpressibly attractive about Liszt, something above and bchind that marvellous executive skill which put. him at the head of, all pianoforte players, There was really a great deal noble and chivalrous about this man, who, disgusted at the tardiness. of those that undertook to'gathey funds for the monument of Beethoven, resolved to become personally responsible fer the completion of the me_morial, and carried out his views too, giving concert after concert for the purpose, nor resting. till he stood proudly before the completed statue to Beetho.""]",Martínez,NIL,person,NIL,Q906471,0,0,1,0,NIL,0,0.8947368421052632,0.8673469387755102,0.8808290155440415

Looking however, at the subject of Franz’s Opera and the dramatic action it indicates, we begin to doubt whether the absence of the latter, as in the present case, would not, in some parts at least, be rather an advantage to the music than otherwise. The following is the plot (we are quoting the International Gazette of April the 24th) :—* ‘Der Warwolf’ is laid in the time of the thirty years’ war. The beast itself had the misfortune of being a wolf by night, and a man by day instead of a wolf all the time; and he is also endowed with certain magical powers.

Teofilo, ‘who has acquired s so great a reputation by his religious compositions, and who was of the school of Clari and Sacchini. In vocal music and poetic expression he formed himself after Zingarelli. We regard Bandonelli as possessing a decided genius for poetry and a fine talent for music. His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value. He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author. If Ban‘donelli were as original, and rich in invention as he is happy in the choice of his melodies, he would acquire an immortal title to celebrity.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art! Grazioli (who must not be confounded with the composer of the same name, who died at Venice in 1820) .', ""Ay monast the chang eS of the time, we have had frequent occasion toremark, that there is none mofesingular orcomplete than the taste for rapid Italian comic compositions. In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking.

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'HERR WILHELM)’s performance of the first Allegro and Andante of Rubinstein’s Violin Concerto in G, at the third concert, was in every respect admirable. The composition, too, is highly interesting, the Allegro, especially, being a finely written movement and containing some most effective conversational passages between the solo instrument and the orchestra. The principal orchestral piece—Schumann’s Symphony in B flat, No. 4—was a welcome item in the rogramme, and was on the whole extremely well played.', 'The pieces are a quartet and chorus from Haydn, a base solo and quartet from Himmel, a trio from Cherubini, a duet for tenor _..and base from a MS. of Naumann, a quartet from the Benedictus of Huminel’s first mass, a quartet and chorus of Andreas Romberg, a quartet, from a rare MS. of Bonelli, and a Tantum ergo and chorus by Mr: Novello. The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces. A hymn by Haydn, a quartet, a Salva Regina, of great power, by Danzi—an exquisite quartet and treble solo from Mozart—a prayer and choral motet, very learnedly put together by Schict, are all nearly equally re- \x0c 254 a . ° NOVELLO’S MOTETS. markable for solemnity and grandeur—a quartet and base solo from Winter are ina lighter but more captivating manner. A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us.

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'We never heard Madame Dulcken play better ;—in the immensely difficult quintet of Spohr, especially, and in the picturesque sonata of Beethoven, she absolutely astouished her audience. The wind instruments were delicious ; the names of Ribas, Laza rus, Jarrett, and Baumann, were a sufficient guarantee for this. The quintet of Onslow, went to perfection. We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.', 'eethoven’s trio in G major, for piano, violin, and violoncello, excellently played by Madame Norman-Neruda, Mr. Charles Hallé, and Monsieur Vieuxtemps, and a violin solo, a Fantasia on Der Freischiitz, by Madame Norman Neruda, accompanied by Mr. Hallé, were features in the programme. A new part-song, composed by Mr. Alfred R. Gaul, of Birmingham, “ The Silent Land,” was well sung by the choir. Mr. Charlies Halié played a pianoforte solo—Nocturne in D flat, and “Wanderer’s Song” (Chopin), and a “Hunting Piece” (Rheinberger), so brilliantly that an encore was elicited.

Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers.
