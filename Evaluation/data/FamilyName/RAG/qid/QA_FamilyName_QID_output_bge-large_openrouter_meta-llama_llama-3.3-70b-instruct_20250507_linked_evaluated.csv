What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'Hippolyte “et Arcie (such was the title of Rameau’s first work) was brought out on the Ist of October, 1783. Rameau was then fifty years old.', 'T transcribe these pretty words, because it is remarkable that they were written to the music, which was a minuet already published by Rameau amongst his harpsichord music. This air is charming, and perfectly in place: it has but one faultnamely, that of being much too high for the voice of the singer for whom it was written ; at the same time, it would be too low if it were transposed. We see that a hundred years since, as in our own times, (but, perhaps, rather less frequently) poets were cbliged to submit the rhythm of their words to the will of the musician, \x0c It would be troublesome to our readers to continue an examination of operas which are perfectly unknown to them. It will be sufficient to give a list of the dramatic works of Rameau; he bronght out successfully, Les Talens Lyriques, 1739; Dardanus,1739 ; Les Fétes de Polymnie,1745 ; LaPrincesse de Navarre, 1745; Le Temple de la Gloire, 1745; Les Fétes de VHymen, et del Amour, 1747 ; Zais, 1748 ; Pygmalion, 1748 ; [lais,1749 ; Plateé, 1749 ; Zeroastre, 1749 ; Acanthe et Céphise, 1751; La Guirlande\\751 ; Daphnis et Eglé,\\753; Lysis et Délié, 1753; La Natesanec d’ Osiris, 1754; Anacréon, 1754; Zephire, 1754; Néleé et Mirthis, 1754; lo, 1754; Le retour d’Astreé, 1757; Les surprises, de ? Amour, 1759; Les Sybarites, 1759 ; and Les Paladins,1760. Although most of these pieces are in one act, and of trifling importance, the number must seem prodigious, when we consider that Rameau did not commence his dramatic career until he was 50 years old. Hewas 77 when he composed his last opera, and at his death, which took place four years after, in 1764, three manuscript scores were found ready for representation. Rameau’s scores have only been engraved with a pianoforte arrangement, including some particular orchestral effects here and there.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9012875536480687,0.8490566037735849,0.8743927827897293

Yet there was. no doubt in the minds of our forefathers, nor is there much in our own, that the solid acquisition of an expressive style is likely to be furthered essentially by the knowledge and practice of such studies. And this for the simplest reason in the world—because while they embrace the difficulties, they also depend upon the expressive power of the art. These duets of one of the most able of our modern masters are in the same style, but have little to mark them as the work ofa modern composer.. The characteristics are the same in each moy ement, namely, in the answers and imitations between the parts, and in the modulations and frequent use of chromatics. The melodies are generally of a grave and sedate character, and those in the triple time frequently elegant. - The slow movements are perhaps the best, and these have frequently much tenderness and pathos. We may name the first and eighth as instances. The ninth is a very happy adaptation of the words, but requiring . great delicacy of execution. Indeed the duets are not easy.', 'No.l.

These people afterwards united themseves to the sect of Arian, who introduced dancing into his mode of worship, with new melodies to the metres of Sotades, an ancient and very dissolute author, which, bound into a volume, were substituted for the proper psalms, and which was afterwards solemnly proscribed and condemned to be burnt.

Carey endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a pension from the King at Windsor, because he said his father had composed it. But Henry Carey died in 1743, and in his famous collection of one hundred tunes no melody bearing any resemblance to “ God save the King ” appears, nor did he in his lifetime ever claim to have written it. I might mention that the tune is also ascribed to Purcell, Jones, Young, and Rogers. Dr. Cooke, of Westminster, mentions that it dates prior to the Reformation! All these accounts and claims are very vague, and little reliance can be placed in them.

When we consider that antient muisic has been banished from churches, concerts, and saloons, as unable to resist the brilliant success of the modern, we must agree with the Italians that it is to. the progress of the age and to the constantly changing feelings and opinions | of new generations that it ought to be attributed. ‘ 0 « Ossi, muscoli, nervi, e fibre, sangue, “ Tutto é moderno in noi ; moderne teste Han’ moderni cer velli?”— .', '‘When we see even in Germany the preference given to. the ardent Rossini over the great Mozart, and in the Austrian capital, Vienna, the classic compositions of Beethoven giving \x0c ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF MUSIC IN NAPLES.

We should be unjust towards ourselves if by an ill-directed admiration for antient times, we undervalued the progress that we have made in spite of the rigorists. Musical colouring has gained considerably by Rossini’s new operas. It is not the same with design. - If we examine the best works of this master, we find a freshness and smoothness, and frequently a delicacy before unknown in music, and throughout all a local complexion, young and ardent, calculated to create emotions, at whatever price they may be purchased. Such are the impulses which he has given to his art, and upon which all critics agree. As to the classical exactitude of design which we seek in musical expression and dramatic language, it must be allowed that the epoch which preceded us was much superior to ours, because they pursned solid and continued study.', 'Amongst the orchestras of Naples, that of San Carlo is superior to allothers.

It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau. The second work It may be remarked as a singular thing, that the first opera played in France was composed and performed by churchmen; the words were by the Abbé Perrin, the music by Lambert, the organist of Saint Honoré, and all the singers were chosen from the various parishes. Until the establishment of the Conservatoire, during the revolution, there was no other singing school in France than those in the cathedrals, in which sacred buildings the theatrical rehearsals always took place.', 'Hippolyte “et Arcie (such was the title of Rameau’s first work) was brought out on the Ist of October, 1783. Rameau was then fifty years old.', 'T transcribe these pretty words, because it is remarkable that they were written to the music, which was a minuet already published by Rameau amongst his harpsichord music. This air is charming, and perfectly in place: it has but one faultnamely, that of being much too high for the voice of the singer for whom it was written ; at the same time, it would be too low if it were transposed. We see that a hundred years since, as in our own times, (but, perhaps, rather less frequently) poets were cbliged to submit the rhythm of their words to the will of the musician, \x0c It would be troublesome to our readers to continue an examination of operas which are perfectly unknown to them. It will be sufficient to give a list of the dramatic works of Rameau; he bronght out successfully, Les Talens Lyriques, 1739; Dardanus,1739 ; Les Fétes de Polymnie,1745 ; LaPrincesse de Navarre, 1745; Le Temple de la Gloire, 1745; Les Fétes de VHymen, et del Amour, 1747 ; Zais, 1748 ; Pygmalion, 1748 ; [lais,1749 ; Plateé, 1749 ; Zeroastre, 1749 ; Acanthe et Céphise, 1751; La Guirlande\\751 ; Daphnis et Eglé,\\753; Lysis et Délié, 1753; La Natesanec d’ Osiris, 1754; Anacréon, 1754; Zephire, 1754; Néleé et Mirthis, 1754; lo, 1754; Le retour d’Astreé, 1757; Les surprises, de ? Amour, 1759; Les Sybarites, 1759 ; and Les Paladins,1760. Although most of these pieces are in one act, and of trifling importance, the number must seem prodigious, when we consider that Rameau did not commence his dramatic career until he was 50 years old. Hewas 77 when he composed his last opera, and at his death, which took place four years after, in 1764, three manuscript scores were found ready for representation.

Then there is the Capriccio by Bach for the harpsichord, written in 1704, representing the dissuasion of a beloved brother from a hazardous journey, his resistance of the same, and his departure, and concluding with a fugue on the notes of the postboy’s horn; and what can be more modern in purpose than this, more descriptive, or more programmatical? There are the same composer’s Pastoral Symphony in his Christmas Oratorio, and Handel’s piece of the same name in his Messiah, both figuring the shepherds at watch in the bright starlight on the night of the Nativity. There is the Symphony in Samson, to represent the falling of the building overthrown by the miraculous strength of the blind hero—almost the single instance of Handel’s use of chromatic passing notes—and that in Belshazzar, which is quaintly, but characteristically marked “ Allegro postillions,” to accompany the supposed hurried entrance of the throng of wise men summoned to interpret the prophetic writing on the wall; and need one look in the works of any age for a truer image of the feeling prevalent among the dramatic persons than the Dead March in Saul or the Jubilant March in Judas Maccabzus ? Haydn’s representation of the earthquake in his Seven Last Words, and of chaos in his Creation, bring the art of descriptive instrumental music a generation nearer to our own age. Even Beethoven, the accredited inventor of the practice, was forestalled by a few years in his design of the Sinfonia Pastorale, the earlier conception of pourtraying pastcral life in orchestral music being due to one Knecht, an obscure composer, who wrought in a place, little less unknown, called Biberach. Glorious specimens of descriptive music are Beethoven’s Overtures, all four of them, to Leonore, that to Coriolan, and that to Egmont; and his Sonata representing a farewell, absence, and a return, belongs to the same category. Rossini worked with the brush of a scene-painter in his Overture to Guillaume Tell and in the representations of a storm that divide the action of the second act in the Barbiere, Matilda di Shabran, and other of his comic Operas. Spohr evinced his descriptive power in his Symphonies, the Consecration of Sound, the Contention between Earthliness and Godliness in the soul of man, and the Seasons, and in his Overture to Azor and Zemira, representing the storm, the wreck of the merchant’s vessel, and his magical rescue. Weber’s Concert Stiick tells a complete story of anxiety in absence, a knight’s return, his true love’s eager rush to meet him, and their rapture in each other’s embrace. The success of Mendelssohn has been equal to that of the best of them in his Overtures, and in his Reformation Symphony and in those two orchestral works recording his impressions in Scotland and in Italy. The tone-pictures by Sterndale Bennett, namely, the Naiades, the Wood-Nymphs, and Paradise and the Peri, are each a masterpiece.

It has been a generally received opinion, that, however deeply his loss was deplored by our poet, the death of Gravina was a great benefit to his future fame, for it is supposed that, had he lived, his advice would have cramped his pupil's ideas, disposed to all the pathos and beauty of passion and nature, with the rules and imitations of the Greek drama. Certain it is, however, that Metastasio mourned over his patron as a son; nor was his gratitude at all diminished, when by Gravina’s will, signed in 1718, he found himself sole master of all his property, consisting of 15,000 crowns, a superb library, and a small estate in the kingdoin of Naples. The generosity of our poet’s disposition, however, soon ran through this possession; and two years after Gravina’s death, all that re' mained to him was an inconsiderable landed estate. Finding it, therefote, necessary to court some other genius than the Muse, he placed himself under the care of Paglietti, a man described as made up wholly of law, a bitter enemy to poetry, one who hated the sound of rhyme, and the very sight of a poet, and who was mercilessly, intolerant of the slightest deviation from worldly prudence. For one year Metastasio applied himself with so much diligence to the labours imposed upon him by Paglietti, that he appears to have disappointed his susvicions, and even to have gained his confidence ; but at the end of that time, we find him again sacrificing to the Muse his contract with the law.

His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors.

In 1746 he sung at the \x0c ON THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE BASsooN. 197 opera, but afterwards applied himself to the bassoon. He was a composer of chants and of instrumental music. These works are . written in the style of Graun. He returned to Strelitz, where he married a singer, a pupil of the celebrated Astrua. After this he passed to the service of the Duke of Holstein, in the capacity of master of the chapel. . In 1763 he composed a grand cantata for the chapel of Sonderhausen, which was performed at a féte on the birth-day of the Prince of Swartzburg.

I do not pretend to have found out anything new, for the controversy dates back to the year 1745-6, when Dr. Arne and his sister, Mrs. Cibber, brought the tune into notice, and such favour did it then gain that S. Carey endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a pension from the King at Windsor, because he said his father had composed it. But Henry Carey died in 1743, and in his famous collection of one hundred tunes no melody bearing any resemblance to “ God save the King ” appears, nor did he in his lifetime ever claim to have written it. I might mention that the tune is also ascribed to Purcell, Jones, Young, and Rogers. Dr. Cooke, of Westminster, mentions that it dates prior to the Reformation! All these accounts and claims are very vague, and little reliance can be placed in them.

This air is charming, and perfectly in place: it has but one faultnamely, that of being much too high for the voice of the singer for whom it was written ; at the same time, it would be too low if it were transposed. We see that a hundred years since, as in our own times, (but, perhaps, rather less frequently) poets were cbliged to submit the rhythm of their words to the will of the musician, \x0c It would be troublesome to our readers to continue an examination of operas which are perfectly unknown to them. It will be sufficient to give a list of the dramatic works of Rameau; he bronght out successfully, Les Talens Lyriques, 1739; Dardanus,1739 ; Les Fétes de Polymnie,1745 ; LaPrincesse de Navarre, 1745; Le Temple de la Gloire, 1745; Les Fétes de VHymen, et del Amour, 1747 ; Zais, 1748 ; Pygmalion, 1748 ; [lais,1749 ; Plateé, 1749 ; Zeroastre, 1749 ; Acanthe et Céphise, 1751; La Guirlande\\751 ; Daphnis et Eglé,\\753; Lysis et Délié, 1753; La Natesanec d’ Osiris, 1754; Anacréon, 1754; Zephire, 1754; Néleé et Mirthis, 1754; lo, 1754; Le retour d’Astreé, 1757; Les surprises, de ? Amour, 1759; Les Sybarites, 1759 ; and Les Paladins,1760. Although most of these pieces are in one act, and of trifling importance, the number must seem prodigious, when we consider that Rameau did not commence his dramatic career until he was 50 years old. Hewas 77 when he composed his last opera, and at his death, which took place four years after, in 1764, three manuscript scores were found ready for representation. Rameau’s scores have only been engraved with a pianoforte arrangement, including some particular orchestral effects here and there.', 'At the next service, instead of the beautiful harmonies to which they were uccustomed, nothing was heard but a confusion of indistinct sounds, in fact, an assemblage of the most discordant notes, and a melange of squeaking and msupportable noises. The organist’s intention was apparent, and it was supposed this folly could not last long ; but a month passed, and still this frightful uproar continued. At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.', 'I Now no example of the vanity of worldly glory So striking as that which is the destiny of illustrious composers. Almost all receive a crown of immortality from their contemporaries, but there are few who conquer the indifference of succeeding generations. Lully’s productions were listened to nearly a century after his death; but Rameau, though not less celebrated, did not enjoy the same good fortune, A few years after Rameaun’s death, Gluck and Piccini accomplished a great musical revolution, which opened a new era in French music, for I consider Gluck a French composer, although he was a Germap by birth; his works, composed in France, bear very little resemblance to the Italian or German school; on the contrary they possess dramatic qualities which are the essence of the French school, and the germ of which might be discovered, although developed with less genius and talent, in the works of Lully and Rameau.

At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie.

Lully’s productions were listened to nearly a century after his death; but Rameau, though not less celebrated, did not enjoy the same good fortune, A few years after Rameaun’s death, Gluck and Piccini accomplished a great musical revolution, which opened a new era in French music, for I consider Gluck a French composer, although he was a Germap by birth; his works, composed in France, bear very little resemblance to the Italian or German school; on the contrary they possess dramatic qualities which are the essence of the French school, and the germ of which might be discovered, although developed with less genius and talent, in the works of Lully and Rameau.

Earl Dudley, who had kindly granted the use of his house for the meeting, occupied the chair, and in presenting the testimonial made a most eloquent speech, in which he spoke in the highest terms of Sir Julius, and made many graceful allusions to the estimation he was held in by the most eminent artists, and the popularity obtained by his innumerable compositions, especially alluding to the honour conferred upon him by Her Majesty. Sir Julius Benedict, in returning thanks, said :— I cannot find adequate words to express the feelings that come upon me at thismoment. I cannot thank you sufficiently for this splendid testimonial which you and other friends have just presented to me under this hospitable roof by the hands of Lord Dudley.

J. Gauntlett, on the a2ist ult., in the 71st year of his age. Few, if any, musicians have done so much for Church music in this country as he whose decease we are now recording. For the last forty years Dr. Gauntlett had been engaged in composing, editing, and publishing psalm-tunes, chants, and anthems; and there is hardly an important. collection of Church music published within that time in the preparation of which he was not concerned either as editor or contributor.', 'Srr,—I have been lately looking through various books and manuscripts in order to enlighten myself and to become acquainted with the various bearings of the much-vexed question as to who was. the composer of our National Anthem. I do not pretend to have found out anything new, for the controversy dates back to the year 1745-6, when Dr. Arne and his sister, Mrs. Cibber, brought the tune into notice, and such favour did it then gain that S. Carey endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a pension from the King at Windsor, because he said his father had composed it. But Henry Carey died in 1743, and in his famous collection of one hundred tunes no melody bearing any resemblance to “ God save the King ” appears, nor did he in his lifetime ever claim to have written it. I might mention that the tune is also ascribed to Purcell, Jones, Young, and Rogers. Dr. Cooke, of Westminster, mentions that it dates prior to the Reformation! All these accounts and claims are very vague, and little reliance can be placed in them. But the following is, I apprehend, much more worthy of belief, and will, I trust, in some way account for the tune being heard at St. Cyr, as Mr. Allen mentions in his letter to you last month.', 'Many of his anthems are of real musical value; but it is as a composer of psalm-tunes that he will be best remembered hereafter. Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public.

I do not pretend to have found out anything new, for the controversy dates back to the year 1745-6, when Dr. Arne and his sister, Mrs. Cibber, brought the tune into notice, and such favour did it then gain that S. Carey endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a pension from the King at Windsor, because he said his father had composed it. But Henry Carey died in 1743, and in his famous collection of one hundred tunes no melody bearing any resemblance to “ God save the King ” appears, nor did he in his lifetime ever claim to have written it. I might mention that the tune is also ascribed to Purcell, Jones, Young, and Rogers. Dr. Cooke, of Westminster, mentions that it dates prior to the Reformation! All these accounts and claims are very vague, and little reliance can be placed in them.

It has been already remarked in our _pages, that not-even the great cities of Italy are willing to receive the music composed for others, but must each have its own. If the English (“ Nation boutiquiere,”’ as foreigners report us), can clearly comprehend how demand produces supply, it will not be difficuit for them to understand how the principle applies to cavatinas as well as cottons. The fact is so. While we glorify Handel and a few others in s#cula seculorum (as indeed he well deserves), the Italian forgets the compositions though not the names of all , that are by-gone and desires novelty—with novelty be it remembered he, also obtaiiis progression and-perhaps polish. | To prove our statement, one of Sacchini’s best.operas was not long since revived at Naples, but it was performed only one night. A worse fate attended the once favourite Buona Fightola at Milan, where the audience would not hear it out. Our own countrymen may however make it their boast, that while. they reverence their own masters they are not leas anxious »* See vol. 6, page 418.', 'I yield, however, completely and unreservedly to the Italians during this period, and I refer those of your readers who may wish to examine a little. further into causes, to the Review of Mr. Bishop’s Operas, at page 198 of your First Volume, where the facts are stated and discussed at some length. Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually. I-esteem such a circumstance to be rather honourable in the comparison I have endeavoured to maintain, because even under the most unfavourable influence, English genius developed and manifested its powers. Nothing can more clearly demonstrate my position than the history of Arne, given in the Review to which [have just referred.

I do not pretend to have found out anything new, for the controversy dates back to the year 1745-6, when Dr. Arne and his sister, Mrs. Cibber, brought the tune into notice, and such favour did it then gain that S. Carey endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a pension from the King at Windsor, because he said his father had composed it. But Henry Carey died in 1743, and in his famous collection of one hundred tunes no melody bearing any resemblance to “ God save the King ” appears, nor did he in his lifetime ever claim to have written it. I might mention that the tune is also ascribed to Purcell, Jones, Young, and Rogers. Dr. Cooke, of Westminster, mentions that it dates prior to the Reformation! All these accounts and claims are very vague, and little reliance can be placed in them.

He was an exquisite violinist, an excellent master, and an original composer. In every thing he undertook to perfect, he left the marks ofan inventive imagination, and a reflective mind. By enlarging the strings of the violin, which till then had been thin and weak, and: by lengthening the bow, he softened its tone, which is naturally harsh, and by improving the position of the bow, by hastening or slackening its motion, and by regulating the pressure, he succeeded in producing a peculiarly sweet and fine tone. His compositions are distinguished by that purity and unity of thought, that exquisite simplicity,.that soft anddelicate pathos, so delightful to persons of feeling, yet so difficult to describe. He was a strong example of the truth of this precept of Horace : “ Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem.,’ His natural modesty at first retarded him in his career, only that he might afterwards raise himself the more rapidly to that pitch of exquisite expression which characterizes his compositions, and which is compared by some to the muse of Petrarch, of whose poetry Tartini was a great admirer. Hence we may believe the assertion, that it was his custom, before he began to compose, to read and meditate upon some one of the sonnets of that poet, in order to illumine his imagination with the pure flame of his Platonic and sublime passion.* ‘There are some who accuse him of being too sparing in his accompaniments, and certainly if his compositions are compared with others, the difference in this respect is but too visible ; but this defect-soon disappears, when we reflect that the delicate colouring of the style of Tartini would.']",Tartini,Q108555,person,Q99911979,Q99911979,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9012875536480687,0.8490566037735849,0.8743927827897293

The other counter-tenor whom I allude to, was one Pichot, a singer at the church of Notre Dame; he was very aged, and had still an extraordinarily powerful voice ; when he sang at B or C his voice sounded above all the others, and was heard all over the Cathedral; [I must add, that in his case, as in that of Barbier, the sound was not very agreeable.

The solo parts were admirably sustained by Madame Stolz, Madame Waldmann, ‘Signor Masini, and Signor Medini, the first named lady displaying a clear and liquid soprano voice, eminently suited to give the utmost effect to Signor Verdi’s music. Madame Wald‘mann was also in every respect highly satisfactory, and both tenor and bass acquitted themselves of their arduous task most successfully, Signor Masini, however, occasionally indulging in a tremolo which much detracted from the effect of his really beautiful voice. The choruses were finely sung by the Royal Albert Hall Choir (which had been previously well drilled by Mr. Barnby), and the orchestra was everything that could be desired.

In the vastness of its outline, the restlessness of its character, and the minuteness of its detail, it forcibly reminded us of a work recently produced by a young Englishman (Mr. Charles Horsley), with brilliant success, at one of the soirées of the “Society of British Musicians.’ How delighted should we have been to hear the talents of the four distinguished artists who interpreted it, with Sterndale Bennett at their head, bestowed upon this fine work of a brother musician! What would we not give to hear Bennett's interpretation of the work which we but lately spoke of with such sincere enthusiasm—and which is not only admirably suited to his style of execution, but is scarcely inferior in merit to the quartet of Mendelssohn, which was executed on Monday night with such wonderful energy and power! Who knows but we may yet hear it atthe third soirée? Poor Miss Ley, who has a delicious soprano voice, was too frightened at her audience (and no wonder) to leave us any opportunity of judging of her capabilities as a vocalist; she was very indulgently received, however.

Hence we may believe the assertion, that it was his custom, before he began to compose, to read and meditate upon some one of the sonnets of that poet, in order to illumine his imagination with the pure flame of his Platonic and sublime passion.* ‘There are some who accuse him of being too sparing in his accompaniments, and certainly if his compositions are compared with others, the difference in this respect is but too visible ; but this defect-soon disappears, when we reflect that the delicate colouring of the style of Tartini would.']",Canova,Q5547,person,Q37508664,Q37508664,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9012875536480687,0.8490566037735849,0.8743927827897293

But you can do as you like; music is a free art, and you probably think you can justify such instrumentation by saying toa critic like me, ‘Heaven is far away above us, and-God will better hear my prayer if Imakea horrible noise in my Ayrie.’ But, I repeat, you. can please yourself; nay, .you may put a large irk-blot on your score-—or on your nose, if you please; they are both your own !” Especially was it Spontini, the composer of the operas Vestalin, Cortes, Olympus, Nurmahal, etc., at that time principal director of music of the Court of Berlin, whose instrumentation Zelter abhorred:. Once while walking home from one of Spontini’s operas (Nurmahal), where not only ‘all kinds of trumpets, drums, tympans and trombones, but also thirty iron anvils, tuned in different keys, had clashed and thundered,—and, in passing the royal castle and- hearing the great tattoo, an_ ensemble of ‘bands, trumpeters, drummers, pipers, and horners, of the whole garrison, Zelter exclaimed to his friends, ‘‘Heaven be’ praised | after all this opera-hoise we hear at last a little sweet music. 7 7 Such a don-mot sinks often decper into a young composer's heart than a whole course of instruction.

Its history is somewhat curious. From a note prefixed by the composer to the old edition of the score, we learn that the -work was originally a series of orchestral movements written for a church in Cadiz for performance in Passion Week. The officiating Bishop delivered from the pulpit a series of discourses on the seven last words, and the interval between each was filled by a portion of this oratorio. The work therefore at first consisted of a number of symphonic movements, and the text was added several years: later.', 'Haydn’s biographers state of him that he always conceived a story before he wrote a Symphony, such as of a sea voyage with the vicissitudes of prosperity and tempest, of a course of true love which never yet ran smooth, or of a departure to battle and a victorious return, and that the music is the language wherein these unacknowledged tales are told. Haydn is not the single instance of a composer who has passed through such a mental process. It signifies nothing to the argument whether the artist be the inventor or only the illustrator of his theme; Shakspeare’s Tempest may be before his mind’s eye when he paints his fanciful. tone-portrait, or a conceit of a storm at sea with its results that never had action outside his own thoughts, or the loss of the Medusa, or any other veritable shipwreck ; and he may amuse himself, if no one else, by making his music wild or tranquil, agitated or serene, according as bad or good weather prevails in his imagination, and as the fears or hopes are paramount of the voyagers. This is not all; without admitting, even to himself, a plot, he is yet a narrator, if only of the thoughts and feelings that live and work within him during his period of composition. The same man will produce a graver work or a gayer, a calmer or a more agitated, a month sooner or later in his life, according to the passions that sway his heart, and be unconscious all the while that he is setting down an autobiography. It is hard to believe, indeed, that any artistic work can be all expressionless, save only a scholastic exercise; nay, perhaps not even this, for the man’s patience or his want of it, his resignation or his eagerness will speak out in the smoothness or roughness of his lines, in the formality or quaintness of his words, in the fluency or angularity of his counterpoint.', 'People are apt to quote “ the German school” as authority in these cases.

Carey endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain a pension from the King at Windsor, because he said his father had composed it. But Henry Carey died in 1743, and in his famous collection of one hundred tunes no melody bearing any resemblance to “ God save the King ” appears, nor did he in his lifetime ever claim to have written it. I might mention that the tune is also ascribed to Purcell, Jones, Young, and Rogers. Dr. Cooke, of Westminster, mentions that it dates prior to the Reformation! All these accounts and claims are very vague, and little reliance can be placed in them. But the following is, I apprehend, much more worthy of belief, and will, I trust, in some way account for the tune being heard at St. Cyr, as Mr. Allen mentions in his letter to you last month.', '&c.; also communications from many of his musical friends, in the nature of commendatory letters.

Already has been suggested that every work of art is a subjective picture, a confession of the joys or sorrows of him who produces it. In this respect, an unentitled piece of music somewhat resembles a landscape or a pastoral poem, which possesses a personal character, in so far as it may express the feelings of the author, beyond the positive facts of which it is a statement, namely, that there is a tree to the right hand, or a brook to the left, or a hill in the distance, or the warm glow of a summer heaven pervading the whole. To-day, one may regard these objects with grateful devotion; to-morrow, with regret for the companion with whom he once viewed them; again, in the overflow of animal spirits: springing from health or from some fortune apart from the scene; at another time, in the indifference of a purposeless hour; anon, in the despair of frustrated endeavour.

Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.']",Prout,Q5331730,person,Q28123732,Q28123732,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9012875536480687,0.8490566037735849,0.8743927827897293

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired.

Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded.

Admitting that the diapason has ascended a whole tone during acentury, this note would be G flat, and there is no tenor capable of singing a piece which constantly goes up to F, G, A, B. The method of producing the voice is entirely changed, and we no longer find those clear counter-tenor voices which ascended with so much facility. J know not whether there still exist any in the choruses of our lyrical theatres. I recollect having known two individuals possessing voices of this nature; one was a chorus singer of the Opera Comigue, an excellent musician named Barbier ; he sang C in his chest voice as easily as another would G. This C was frightful I admit, but, nevertheless, it wars C sung without effort. The other counter-tenor whom I allude to, was one Pichot, a singer at the church of Notre Dame; he was very aged, and had still an extraordinarily powerful voice ; when he sang at B or C his voice sounded above all the others, and was heard all over the Cathedral; [I must add, that in his case, as in that of Barbier, the sound was not very agreeable. It was thus that tenors sang in the time of Rameau. There isin Castor et Pollur a battle song for their kind of voice: LEclatez, fieres trompettes. It is the most burlesque thing imaginable, andif any artist of the present day were capable of executing it, I would guarantee him an engagement in any lyrical theatre in Europe.', '> We have now brought the history of the French school of the violin up to our ewntimes.

Yet, let us be grateful for what he has ettected —enough in all conscience to smother censure ; let us snatch the seattered beauties that abound in his Gustave—his Bayaderehis Philtre--his Lestocq—his Ambassadrice—his Diamans de la Couronne—and above all, his Domino Noir—operas replete with elegance, though wanting in the uni¢y and connected design of his two great works, Meverbeer comes next, with his romantic and grotesque giganticisms, (in which the inexhaustible genius of Scribe, that polyglot among dramatists, shines almost as preeminently as his own)— Rovert /e Diable, Les Huguenots—leviathans, vast, terrible, mis-shapenwith their universe of scenic effect—their volcanic masses of sound—painfully exciting—fatiguing to the mind—marked by a feverish restlessness which gives no repose to the mind’s ear. Consider them as works of art—strip them of their academical habiliments—their grand and fiery orchestra—their voluptuous 4a//e¢—their dazzling decorations and enchanting scenery‘alter the mise en scene—and in their nakedness, they would scarcely bear the eagle eye of' strict analysis—they would become rich prey for the soured spirit of the critic—and, in fact, would lose half their grandeur, with their clothingtheir effect, so brilliant, so imposing, being but the result of abstract ornament. To speak plainly, the operas of Meyerbeer—though often evincing indications of genius—regarded as scientific creations, can only be classed among second rate productions. Yet FE must confess that in alluding to them, I can well afford to exclaim with Horace: ~Uhi plura niteut in carmine non ego paucis Offendar maculis.”’ After these three, and only after them, from the fact that, as vet, he has not distinguished himself as a dramatic composer, I should place Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy,* the king of faéry music--the magician of dreams—whose glowing and exuberant imagination is so remarkably developed in his orchestral overtures; his sfelusina—his Isles of Fingal—his Midsummer Night's Perhaps I am unjust in excluding Spontini and Marschner from the rank which their admirers claim for them among the first composers of the day—but I must candidly avow that, though I admit their great endowments, I do not think them worthy of being classed among writers of such superlative genius as Rossini and Auber."", 'M.
