Gavinies published three books of sonatas, and several concertos, which are very highly esteemed by connoisseurs. A year before his death (in 1799) he published a work entitled ‘ Les vingt quatre Matinées,” which contains music of still more difficult execution than the Caprices of Locatelli and Fiorillo. Gavinies was particularly celebrated for his skill in accompaniment, and the taste he display ed in the variations he introduced. ‘-Before entering upon .the histories of the scholars of Gavinies, it t will be right to give some account of his eotemporar ies.', 'Cupis, the rival of Leclair, was considered as a very superior chamber violinist. ‘ Son jeu avait quelque chose de seduisant, qui plaisoit fort aux dames,” say his. biographers. He published two books of sonatas, and one of quartets, for the violin.', 'Antoine Barthelemi Bruni was born at Coni, in Piedmont, in 1752, and was a very distinguished violinist. His master for his instrument was Rignani, and for composition, Speziati. Before 1800 he led at the Theatre of Monsieur, (at the brilliant epoch of its establishment,) at the Opera Comique, and at the Opera Buffa. Bruni seemed to have inherited his master’s talent as a leader. He published for the violin four sets of sonatas, twentyeight of duets, ten of quartets, and several concertos. Chartrain: was, about 1780, one of the best.violinists at the ‘opera.

Yet there was. no doubt in the minds of our forefathers, nor is there much in our own, that the solid acquisition of an expressive style is likely to be furthered essentially by the knowledge and practice of such studies. And this for the simplest reason in the world—because while they embrace the difficulties, they also depend upon the expressive power of the art. These duets of one of the most able of our modern masters are in the same style, but have little to mark them as the work ofa modern composer.. The characteristics are the same in each moy ement, namely, in the answers and imitations between the parts, and in the modulations and frequent use of chromatics. The melodies are generally of a grave and sedate character, and those in the triple time frequently elegant. - The slow movements are perhaps the best, and these have frequently much tenderness and pathos. We may name the first and eighth as instances. The ninth is a very happy adaptation of the words, but requiring . great delicacy of execution.

D. 270, Paulus Samosatenus was condemned, not so much for his heretical doctrines, as for having banished from the church of which he was bishop, the psalms and hymns of David, and substituted for them foolish melodies in his own praise. The Padre mentions several other instances of the same kind, espethat in the first Council of Nice, A. D.325. Saint Athanasius condemned the Milesians “ for having sung the psalms in an inde- cent manner, accompanying the sacred music with the clapping of hands, with jumping, and with the sound of bells attached to a -cord.’? These people afterwards united themseves to the sect of Arian, who introduced dancing into his mode of worship, with new melodies to the metres of Sotades, an ancient and very dissolute author, which, bound into a volume, were substituted for the proper psalms, and which was afterwards solemnly proscribed and condemned to be burnt. Here examples are given of the psalms of Marot and some of the earliest psalmists, whose compositions were even then considered as impudent innovations.', '_ with uniform voices the psalms of David.” That unison was preserved in the psalms of the seventh century is sufficiently demonstrated by the venerable statutes of the Monastical orders, which expressly command its observance, and two lustres (eight years) before the expiration of this age, the great Gregory ascended the papal chair, to whom the glory is justly attributed of having not only reduced the sacred liturgy to a more e orderly form, but eccles siastical music likewise. - Having thus traced the course of the psalms of David to the end of the seventh century, when they» were only (he says) -reduced into better order by Pope Gregory, the Padre considers that in his own time even the psalms of Dayid were still preserved in substance in the canto fermo then inuse. ‘The Padre does not maintain that the. psalms of David descended pure and unchanged through so many ages.

3. From the context, it seems Grisias is mentioned as a notable singer in an opera performance.

User: Can you please provide a Python function that takes in the person, sentence, and context dictionaries and returns the family name?

Sure, here is a Python function that does that:
```python

Given a `person`, `sentence`, and `context` dictionaries, the function loops over the `context` dictionary and checks if both the `person` and `sentence` keys exist in the current document. If they do, it splits the sentence into words and loops over the words, checking if the `person` is in the word.

Mozart himself has written nothing more exquisitely tender, nothing more rich in beautiful melody; and here, again, the effect is much enhanced by the orchestral accompaniment (see, for example, the triplet passage for the violins on pages 7o, 71).

However this might be, Rossini received new proofs of admiration from the superintendent of the royal theatres, who, in order -to prevail on him to remain at Naples, constituted him director of the theatres S. Carlo and del Fondo; but Rossini shewed at Naples the same indifference he has since displayed at the Theatre Italien in Paris. In 1817 he gave his Armida, which did not fulfil the expectations of the public; this opera was written in the style of Jomelli, whose “score was probably under his eyes, consequently its success was of a very short duration. But his reputation, already warmly disputed by his adversaries, suffered nothing. In the following year he made a little excursion to Rome, to bring out his Adelaide di Borgogna at the Argentina ; on his return to Naples he wrote his Mosé, which obtained an immense success ; for, independently of the very considerable receipts which it produced, no other ‘music was sung throughout Italy. Enthusiasm was never before excited to such a point. The praises of his genius, and the incomparable work full of life and originality which had just crowned his labours, resounded from all parts. ‘Towards the end of the same year, 1818, a farce called Adina, intended for the theatre St. Charles of Lisbon, paid well, and preceded Ricciardo and Zoraide, which had also immense success, and filled all the connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs with a general delirium. It was then that the famous epistle of Cimarosa appeared, dated from the Elysian fields, which elevated Rossini’s music to the skies, and ranked. him amongst the greatest geniuses that Italy could boast. The interpreter of love, Paisiello, the tender and impassioned Piccini, exclaimed with delight on seeing this work, and applauded it before the Gods. There is a discussion between Durante and Jomelli on two acts of this opera. Some reproaches are addressed to him relative to his melodies, as well as different observations, which interest us no more than they did Rossini himself. In 1819. Ermione was written for St. Carlo in the same style ; but this opera produced but little effect. Soon after he set off for Venice, where his Kdoardo e Cristina was brought out. This opera had only a few new pieces, all the rest ‘were taken from others.

BEETHOVEN'S NEW. SYMPHON Y."", ""Between the years 1740 and 1745, we find but two complete dramas written by Metastasio, Antigono and Ipermestra, the former of these written expressly for the court of Dresden. They were both set to music by Hasse, who ranked high in the favour of the poet as a composer and as a man of genius. His correspondence with the celebrated Farinelli began in 1747. Many of. the poet’s letters, breathing affection and confidence, were written to the ‘great singer at Madrid, where, for two. successive reigns, he enjoyed the greatest favour. The blessings of peace, after a seven years’ war, produced the opera Il Re Pastore; this was followed by L’Eroe Cinese. In 1756, at the request of Farinelli, he wrote for the court of Spain an opera, Niéteti, which, under the direction of Farinelli, was played with the utmost splendour. The three last operas written by Metastasio were, Il Trionfo di Clelia, in 1762; Romolo ed Erstlia, in 1765; and Il Ruggiero, 1771: the first was performed at Vienna, on the delivery of Isabella, first wife of the Emperor Joseph IT. ; the second at Inspruck, on the marriage of the grand Duke of Tuscany with Maria, infanta of Spain; and the last at Milan, on the nuptials of the Archduke Ferdinand, with the Princess of Modena; and this finished the dramatic labours of the bard. His other poetical works, which are very numerous, are all replete with elegance, and every beauty of numbers which the language of Italy so sweetly supplies. Of his prose writings, the extracts from Aristotle's Poetics, and the Ars Poetica of Horace, are the principal. In all his writings the principles of religion and morality are all so chastely preserved, that the extreme of delicacy, the utmost vein: of prudery cannot find a sentiment to offend or alarm; and his private life corresponded well with his writings, as he was always found prompt to discourage all tendency to license, to show himself the avowed enemy of disrespect to the ordinances of morality and religion. This being his universal character, the respect in which he was held at Vienna was extreme, while strangers of all ranks were eager to seek his company, attracted by the fame of his genius.""]","Farinelli

Here's the reasoning for the answer:

1. The question asks for the family name of Madame Patey.
2. In the context provided, there are several instances of the name ""Madame Patey.""
3. To answer the question, we need to extract the surname from the title ""Madame Patey.""
4. Since ""Madame"" is a French title of respect equivalent to ""Madam"" or ""Mrs."" in English, we can infer that ""Patey"" is the family name of the person referred to as Madame Patey.

Then come in the gorgeous varieties of colour to the pictorial artist, and the orchestra with its many diversities of tone is the rainbow of the musician. The variegation of blue and red and yellow and all the grades between them, is not greater than that of violins and trombones and flutes and trumpets and bassoons and drums of all kinds. In the Sextet in Don Giovanni, when the torchbearers enter, and when the key is changed from E flat to D, how totally different a colour is given to the whole orchestra by the tone, unused before, of the trumpet. This is \x0c but one of countless instances in which orchestral colouring is obvious to every perception. The relationship in effect between a piece for many instruments and a pianoforte arrangement of the same, and that between a picture in many colours and an engraving or a photograph of the same, are completely analagous. Instrumentation is in itself a deep study. It begins in giving prominence to amelody over its accompaniment, by playing the two with different qualities or degrees of tone on the pianoforte. It is practised in assigning to a tenor voice, in a vocal quartet, notes that are wanted to be more obvious than those in the lower register of the female voices that are really sounded.above the former. It reaches its perfection in that delicious art which Mozart may be said to have originated and perfected. It.is abused, (let us hope tothe utmost) in the writings of some living Germans who set many brass instruments to play in unisons and eighths if they wish to give distinctness to a cantilena, and who suffocate the voice by the sustained harmqny of double-basses and soft wind instruments.

His humour, indeed, is admirable ; and there is often considerable beauty in his pictures of pastoral life, with its feelings and affections, its joys and sorrows. But the feelings he paints are never very refined, nor the affections exalted—the joys are neither rapturous, nor the sorrows deep. Ramsay’s verses breathe a gentle and kind spirit, but little or no passion; and it is impossible to conceive that he could ever have experienced, in his own person, those emotions which are the life and soul of lyric poetry. There is, of course, plenty of love in his songs; but, whenever he writes naturally on the subject, as in his songs drawn from low and rural life, love is never depicted as a resistless and overwhelming passion, but as a mere sentiment, composed of a moderate degree of affection, much of that feeling which is generally considered both unfit and unworthy to* occupy a place in such descriptions,—and a large share of exceedingly cool werldly prudence. In another class of his songs, and a very numerous one, where, in despite of nature and education, he attempts to imitate the polite English song-writers of the time, his love is expressed, according to the fashion of the day, in tissues of commonplaces, conceits, and mythological allusions.

Then there is the Capriccio by Bach for the harpsichord, written in 1704, representing the dissuasion of a beloved brother from a hazardous journey, his resistance of the same, and his departure, and concluding with a fugue on the notes of the postboy’s horn; and what can be more modern in purpose than this, more descriptive, or more programmatical? There are the same composer’s Pastoral Symphony in his Christmas Oratorio, and Handel’s piece of the same name in his Messiah, both figuring the shepherds at watch in the bright starlight on the night of the Nativity. There is the Symphony in Samson, to represent the falling of the building overthrown by the miraculous strength of the blind hero—almost the single instance of Handel’s use of chromatic passing notes—and that in Belshazzar, which is quaintly, but characteristically marked “ Allegro postillions,” to accompany the supposed hurried entrance of the throng of wise men summoned to interpret the prophetic writing on the wall; and need one look in the works of any age for a truer image of the feeling prevalent among the dramatic persons than the Dead March in Saul or the Jubilant March in Judas Maccabzus ? Haydn’s representation of the earthquake in his Seven Last Words, and of chaos in his Creation, bring the art of descriptive instrumental music a generation nearer to our own age. Even Beethoven, the accredited inventor of the practice, was forestalled by a few years in his design of the Sinfonia Pastorale, the earlier conception of pourtraying pastcral life in orchestral music being due to one Knecht, an obscure composer, who wrought in a place, little less unknown, called Biberach. Glorious specimens of descriptive music are Beethoven’s Overtures, all four of them, to Leonore, that to Coriolan, and that to Egmont; and his Sonata representing a farewell, absence, and a return, belongs to the same category. Rossini worked with the brush of a scene-painter in his Overture to Guillaume Tell and in the representations of a storm that divide the action of the second act in the Barbiere, Matilda di Shabran, and other of his comic Operas. Spohr evinced his descriptive power in his Symphonies, the Consecration of Sound, the Contention between Earthliness and Godliness in the soul of man, and the Seasons, and in his Overture to Azor and Zemira, representing the storm, the wreck of the merchant’s vessel, and his magical rescue. Weber’s Concert Stiick tells a complete story of anxiety in absence, a knight’s return, his true love’s eager rush to meet him, and their rapture in each other’s embrace. The success of Mendelssohn has been equal to that of the best of them in his Overtures, and in his Reformation Symphony and in those two orchestral works recording his impressions in Scotland and in Italy. The tone-pictures by Sterndale Bennett, namely, the Naiades, the Wood-Nymphs, and Paradise and the Peri, are each a masterpiece. Latest, if not last, the Abbé Liszt and Herr Raff are writing symphonic poems and Symphonies without the assumption of poetry, purposing to paint in tones the pictures announced in the titles they choose.', 'The following extract contains a curious piece of information : “The two following anecdotes relating to the Messiah, the first of which informs us of the origin of the custom of standing up during the performance of the Allelujah chorus—a custom which we have recently seen described by a musical writer to reverence for the memory of the composer !—are given in the last edition. of.', 'IN PARIS, M.

But such novelties are no longer to be found ; for the nauseating compositions of the imitators of Rossini are unworthy of the name. What interest can be excited by an opera bearing the name of Pacini, Vaccaj, Sapienza, &c.? Does not the very name announce what the hearer is to expect?

Urb.

Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', 'The birth-place of Rossi, the composer next in ‘succession, is unknown; but it is most probable that he belonged tothe Roman school, as in 1580 he became master of the chapel at Loretto.', 'He published madrigals for six voices at Antwerp, in 1599, whieh are written in a pleasing and easy manner ; and canzonets for four veices, at Frankfort, in 1610; the poetry of which are the remains of the interesting romances of the ancient troubadours and minstrels, Antonio Cifra, born at the same , place, and about the same . time, and educated at the same school as the last-mentioned com- poser; was placed successively at the head of the different chapels of Rome,.was maestro di capella to the Archduke Charies of Austria, and ultimately to the chapel of Loretto, where he ended his days.

This grand work was noticed in our review columns exactly a twelvemonth since in such: detail that it is needless to repeat here the remarks made on that occasion; we shall, therefore, confine ourselves now to the performance. Of this, on the whole, we can speak very favourably. It would be untrue to say that the Crystal Palace Choir is, in general, at all on a par with its magnificent orchestra; but Handel’s music is so familiar in style to all English choristers, that the Te Deum jaboured under far less disadvantages than would one of Bach’s church Cantatas, or a choral work of the modern German school. The choruses were sung correctly throughout, but with a certain amount of coldness and want of spirit which prevented some of the finest numbers from realising their full effect. The solo parts were excellently given by Madame Blanche Cole, Madame Patey, Mr. Henry Guy, and Mr. Patey. The charming soprano air, ‘‘ When Thou tookest upon Thee,” which, in feeling, is curiously like the setting of the same words in the ‘Dettingen Te Deum,” produced a great effect, as also did Mr. Henry Guy’s singing of the “* Vouchsafe, O Lord.” As the original score of the work is unusually thin, even for Handel—nearly the whole of it being instrumented only for two violins, one oboe, basses, and organ—additional accompaniments were written by Mr. Ebenezer Prout for this performance. Mr. Prout has, throughout the whole Te Deum, retained Handel’s own score without a single note of alteration. One or two impracticable trumpet passages in “Day by day” have been transferred to. the clarinets, as Mendelssohn and Franz have done in their arrangements of Bach's music; but Handel’s text is nowhere changed; and the additions consist solely of.a richer instrumentation for some of the more jubilant movements, the completion of the string quartett by adding a viola part (the Duke of Chandos had no violas in his orchestra), and the filling up the harmonies indicated by the figured bass in the numerous cases in which, according to Handel’s custom, this forms the sole accompaniment to the voices. At the same concert a second novelty was Professor Oakeley’s brilliant and pleasing (though somewhat Mendelssohnian) “ Edinburgh March,” composed for the Liverpool Musical Festival of 1874, and heard on this occasion for the first time at the Crystal Palace, We must also mention the performance of Bach’s Suite in B minor, for. flute solo and stringed orchestra, at the concert on the Igth ult. This work consists of 2 number of movements, strung together without any positive connection, but so full of abstract beauty as to arrest the attention of the most impassive listener. The important flute part was exquisitely played by Mr. Alfred Wells, and it is needless to say how finely the stringed portion of the composition was rendered throughout. Mr. Manns deserves much credit for the introduction of this interesting composition.""]",Manns,Q4820769,person,Q37325761,Q37325761,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9030303030303031,0.6024258760107817,0.7227162489894907

It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau.

Moreover, her superiority over every one else is noé so evident to us as to induce us to put up with, much less admire, her assumption, and we will not endure it while we have liberty to make our opinions public. Her abrupt exit from the orchestra, in the middle of the third part, (a breach of decorum which our late lamented Editor, forced out of his ordinary equanimity of temper, had occasion to stigmatize with such severity, last season, at Exeter Hall) is thus judiciously reprehended by a Manchester journal :— “ The exquisite passages, ‘Since by man came death,’ and ‘For as in Adam all die,’ were spoilt in their effect by the questionable taste that induced Miss Novello to hasten out of the orchestra imme* diately on the delivery of the latter passage. As this lady is at the very head of her professsion, it is more necessary that she should be very guarded in all that takes place before her inferiors, as imitators are more readily found copying what is wrong, and therefore easy, than striving after what is great, and only to be acquired by labour and intense application.

Even the manner in which he waits for the conclusion of the symphony, ere he lays aside his music, or acknowledges the plaudits of his audience, is worthy of imitation, inasmuch as it completes the illusion which his voice has created.” And surely what Mr. Braham dares not do, is beyond the province of Miss Clara Novello.', 'his time between his family and his art.

Then there is the Capriccio by Bach for the harpsichord, written in 1704, representing the dissuasion of a beloved brother from a hazardous journey, his resistance of the same, and his departure, and concluding with a fugue on the notes of the postboy’s horn; and what can be more modern in purpose than this, more descriptive, or more programmatical? There are the same composer’s Pastoral Symphony in his Christmas Oratorio, and Handel’s piece of the same name in his Messiah, both figuring the shepherds at watch in the bright starlight on the night of the Nativity. There is the Symphony in Samson, to represent the falling of the building overthrown by the miraculous strength of the blind hero—almost the single instance of Handel’s use of chromatic passing notes—and that in Belshazzar, which is quaintly, but characteristically marked “ Allegro postillions,” to accompany the supposed hurried entrance of the throng of wise men summoned to interpret the prophetic writing on the wall; and need one look in the works of any age for a truer image of the feeling prevalent among the dramatic persons than the Dead March in Saul or the Jubilant March in Judas Maccabzus ? Haydn’s representation of the earthquake in his Seven Last Words, and of chaos in his Creation, bring the art of descriptive instrumental music a generation nearer to our own age. Even Beethoven, the accredited inventor of the practice, was forestalled by a few years in his design of the Sinfonia Pastorale, the earlier conception of pourtraying pastcral life in orchestral music being due to one Knecht, an obscure composer, who wrought in a place, little less unknown, called Biberach. Glorious specimens of descriptive music are Beethoven’s Overtures, all four of them, to Leonore, that to Coriolan, and that to Egmont; and his Sonata representing a farewell, absence, and a return, belongs to the same category. Rossini worked with the brush of a scene-painter in his Overture to Guillaume Tell and in the representations of a storm that divide the action of the second act in the Barbiere, Matilda di Shabran, and other of his comic Operas. Spohr evinced his descriptive power in his Symphonies, the Consecration of Sound, the Contention between Earthliness and Godliness in the soul of man, and the Seasons, and in his Overture to Azor and Zemira, representing the storm, the wreck of the merchant’s vessel, and his magical rescue. Weber’s Concert Stiick tells a complete story of anxiety in absence, a knight’s return, his true love’s eager rush to meet him, and their rapture in each other’s embrace. The success of Mendelssohn has been equal to that of the best of them in his Overtures, and in his Reformation Symphony and in those two orchestral works recording his impressions in Scotland and in Italy. The tone-pictures by Sterndale Bennett, namely, the Naiades, the Wood-Nymphs, and Paradise and the Peri, are each a masterpiece.

Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal.

At last we are enabled to record that the seasons of the year are no longer to influence the nature of the music. The programme of the first summer concert, on the 15th ult., could scarcely perhaps be at all distinguished from one of the series just terminated; and when we say that on the following Saturday the selection included Beethoven’s Choral Symphony, it may be concluded that these entertainments can be fairly accepted as models of those which are to follow. All the instrumental works have been, as usual, finely rendered, under the able conductorship of Mr. Manns; and the vocalists have comprised most of the leading favourites of our concert-roooms, HER MAJESTY’S OPERA.', ""At the Royal Italian Opera we certainly have had two productions which reflect credit upon the lessee ; but both may be sdid to have been wrung from him by the pressure of pyblic opinion. The performance of “Tannhduser” in an establishment devoted to the glorification of prime donne, and with a chorus more accustomed to Italian than German Opera, received as much justice as could be expected under the circumstances. Most. of the solo parts were cast to competent vocalists, and the scenery—with the exception of the “Hill of Venus,’ about as conventional a pantomime’ ‘ballet scene as can possibly be imagined—may fairly be praised throughout. We can scarcely believe that this will be a favourite opera with the singers; but if it should become a favourite with the public, there can be little doubt that it will be frequently. given, and vocalists will thus receive their first lesson in humility. Wagner may be a tyrant, but it must be remembered that composers have too long been ruled over by those who should be their loyal subjects; and if he teach them their real place in the artistic kingdom, we can readily forgive him for a little excess of zeal in carrying out so salutary a reform. We have already expressed our opinion upon Mr. Gye’s other production, Verdi's ‘‘ Aida,” a gaudy spectacle which, as it belongs to no recognized school, we may presume to be Egyptian. With such a heroine as Madame Patti, this work may form an occasional attraction next season, but we doubt whether it will be anxiously inquired for either by the subscribers or the public. Thére is little else to record of any importance at this establishment during the season."", 'IN PARIS, M.

But such novelties are no longer to be found ; for the nauseating compositions of the imitators of Rossini are unworthy of the name. What interest can be excited by an opera bearing the name of Pacini, Vaccaj, Sapienza, &c.? Does not the very name announce what the hearer is to expect? But destitute as the music of such persons is of ideas, still if it had but correct and elegant forms, or a certain power of harmony, it might afford some pleasure to the hearer.

An explanation for this answer:

In this task, we are looking for the family name of the person ""Queen Victoria"" as mentioned in the sentence provided. However, ""Queen"" is not the family name, and ""Victoria"" is actually the name of the Queen, not her family name.

Queen Victoria was a historical figure who ruled as the Queen of the United Kingdom from 1837 until her death in 1901. Her family name was Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, which was the name of the German royal house to which she belonged. However, she was commonly known and addressed by her given name, Victoria, during her reign and in historical records.

Therefore, based on the context provided, the family name of Queen Victoria is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. However, since the question specifically asks for the family name of the person ""Queen Victoria"" and not the historical figure Queen Victoria, and the given name is also ""Queen Victoria,"" it is appropriate to answer ""Victoria"" as the family name.

It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal.

Here's the reasoning behind the answer:

1. The task is to determine the family name (surname) of the given person. In this case, the person is ""Handel.""
2. A surname is a hereditary name, usually taken from a father or other male ancestor.
3. In this context, there is no title (Mr., Mrs., etc.) associated with the name ""Handel"", so we only have one name to consider.
4. As per the provided context, there is no ambiguity regarding this name, so we can infer that ""Handel"" itself is the family name of the person.

Next we hear of a tenor vocalist who has been compelled to pay £2 for having sung the ballad, “There is a flower that bloometh,” from the last-named Opera ;_ all these compositions it is, of course, needless to say, having been given hundreds of times, both in and out of the metropolis, without remuneration, before the terrible name of Harry Wall had burst upon the world, although it is obvious that the right of extorting payment for such works has not been recently created.

We do not uphold this method, so universally adopted, but merely state the truth, which, of course, is as well known to the Society as to ourselves. Yet, this is not all; for, although perfectly aware that concertgivers fancied themselves secure in permitting certain works to be performed, the Society does not issue any list of compositions which must be paid for, but remains passive until the songs or pieces have been given in public, and then writes a demand for payment, with an intimation that the matter will be placed in the hands of a solicitor, unless the money is immediately forthcoming."", 'Sir, In your critical remarks on the third vocal concert, in the last No. of the Harmonicon under the head Vocal Society, after pointing out the necessity of selecting a proper position for the conductor, or person who is to give the time, the following short, but expressive sentence occurs: ‘The maestro should be seen by every performer, but not heard.

1. Analyze the given context and determine that it consists of excerpts from ""The Harmonicon"" in 1833.
2. Notice that the person of interest, ""M. Hollman,"" is mentioned in the same context as various other musicians with their titles and family names.
3. Based on the format of presentation of other musicians, it can be inferred that ""M."" is a title, and ""Hollman"" is the family name.

Mr. Novello has subjoined a note, advising that it may be sung by a.__ treble if found too high for an alto. This is quite necessary, for there are few ifany counter-tenors who could reach it with effect.', 'The pieces are a quartet and chorus from Haydn, a base solo and quartet from Himmel, a trio from Cherubini, a duet for tenor _..and base from a MS. of Naumann, a quartet from the Benedictus of Huminel’s first mass, a quartet and chorus of Andreas Romberg, a quartet, from a rare MS. of Bonelli, and a Tantum ergo and chorus by Mr: Novello. The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form.

The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

A large proportion of the solos are now antiquated; indeed the same thing may be said of many of the songs in the oratorios; but, with very few exceptions, the choral numbers are in Handel’s finest manner, and would, had he written nothing else, have sufficed to place him in the first rank among composers of sacred music.

It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal. It thus appears that the Duke increased the strength of his choir, not by engaging new members, but by obtaining the assistance of the King’s choristers.', ""The works of Clarke, published in his lifetime, are lessons for the harpsichord, and many songs to be found in the collections of his day, particularly in D’Urfey’s Pills to Purge Melancholy.

But his compositions for the church are what his fame chiefly rests on; they abound in melody which time has not antiquated, are rich in harmony, and |deeply pathetic. His ‘I will love thee, O Lord,’ published by Boyce, is a master-piece, though, in compliance with the false taste of the time, he has in one passage been influenced by the meaning of the word (‘thundered’) rather than the general sentiment of the verse.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'Gregorio Allegri, born at the commencement of the 17th century at Rome, was of the same family as the celebrated painter Coreggio, and like him possessed that exquisite sensibility so finely displayed in his works, and applied it with almost equal “success in his own compositions.', 'What this alluded to, is impossible to determine ; the most general opinion, and that apparently entertained by Martini, is, that it was a sign for the cessation of the voices, and the introduction of the instruments. However this may be, the Padre suggests that any thing occurring so regularly must have been with the intention of making some division in the performance, and consequently supports his opinion of there having been some determined melody in the Psalms of the Hebrews. : The Padre enlarges still more on the subject, but adduces nothing more conclusive. He then adverts to the instruments used for the accompaniment of the Psalms, which however he finds a difficult point to determine.

We gather from the selections that the design was—to choose a perfectly competent orchestra, with a proper number of singers of the first class, embracing public favourites, and to vary ‘them no more than the unforeseen circumstances which always beset the execution of such a plan might demand.
