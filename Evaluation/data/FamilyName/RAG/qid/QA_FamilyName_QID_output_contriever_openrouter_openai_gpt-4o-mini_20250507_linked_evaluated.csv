Arnold’s omission of the “ Jubilate” is not surprising, because his edition of Handel is frequently incomplete. Why the other two anthems cannot be considered as ‘* Chandos anthems” will be seen presently. Moreover, the order adopted by Arnold, in which three, four, and five-part anthems are mixed up promiscuously, seems quite arbitrary; there is, on the contrary, much reason for believing Dr. Chrysander’s to be approximately correct.', 'It would be very interesting to know the exact strength of the Duke’s choir and orchestra, but this seems impossible; at least, in Chrysander’s “ Life of Handel’ no information is given on the subject. It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal. It thus appears that the Duke increased the strength of his choir, not by engaging new members, but by obtaining the assistance of the King’s choristers.']",Chrysander,Q65274,person,Q110801189,Q110801189,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.8948126801152738,0.8369272237196765,0.8649025069637883
