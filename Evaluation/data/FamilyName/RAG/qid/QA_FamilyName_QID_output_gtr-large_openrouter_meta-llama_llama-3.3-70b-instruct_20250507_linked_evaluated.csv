What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'T transcribe these pretty words, because it is remarkable that they were written to the music, which was a minuet already published by Rameau amongst his harpsichord music. This air is charming, and perfectly in place: it has but one faultnamely, that of being much too high for the voice of the singer for whom it was written ; at the same time, it would be too low if it were transposed. We see that a hundred years since, as in our own times, (but, perhaps, rather less frequently) poets were cbliged to submit the rhythm of their words to the will of the musician, \x0c It would be troublesome to our readers to continue an examination of operas which are perfectly unknown to them. It will be sufficient to give a list of the dramatic works of Rameau; he bronght out successfully, Les Talens Lyriques, 1739; Dardanus,1739 ; Les Fétes de Polymnie,1745 ; LaPrincesse de Navarre, 1745; Le Temple de la Gloire, 1745; Les Fétes de VHymen, et del Amour, 1747 ; Zais, 1748 ; Pygmalion, 1748 ; [lais,1749 ; Plateé, 1749 ; Zeroastre, 1749 ; Acanthe et Céphise, 1751; La Guirlande\\751 ; Daphnis et Eglé,\\753; Lysis et Délié, 1753; La Natesanec d’ Osiris, 1754; Anacréon, 1754; Zephire, 1754; Néleé et Mirthis, 1754; lo, 1754; Le retour d’Astreé, 1757; Les surprises, de ? Amour, 1759; Les Sybarites, 1759 ; and Les Paladins,1760. Although most of these pieces are in one act, and of trifling importance, the number must seem prodigious, when we consider that Rameau did not commence his dramatic career until he was 50 years old. Hewas 77 when he composed his last opera, and at his death, which took place four years after, in 1764, three manuscript scores were found ready for representation. Rameau’s scores have only been engraved with a pianoforte arrangement, including some particular orchestral effects here and there.', 'Hippolyte “et Arcie (such was the title of Rameau’s first work) was brought out on the Ist of October, 1783.

Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.', 'At eighteen he set out for Italy, but went no farther than Milan; his pecuniary resources being exhausted, he was compelled to return to France, and he engaged himself as violinist in the orchestra of a party who were making a tour in the south of France. He was enabled, in the course of a few years, to return to Dijon, where he was offered the situation of organist; but what he desired was fame, which prompted him to visit Paris. He refused the offer and hastened to the capital; there it was necessary he should live: an organist’s place would furnish him with the means; there was a vacancy at the church of Sazat Paul ; it was to be filled up by election; Rameau was a candidate ; his opponent, Dagnin, was successful; he was obliged to leave Paris; an organist was required for the church of Saint Etienne at Lille, where he also offered himself and was accepted; but he only remained a short time in this town.

The three last operas written by Metastasio were, Il Trionfo di Clelia, in 1762; Romolo ed Erstlia, in 1765; and Il Ruggiero, 1771: the first was performed at Vienna, on the delivery of Isabella, first wife of the Emperor Joseph IT. ; the second at Inspruck, on the marriage of the grand Duke of Tuscany with Maria, infanta of Spain; and the last at Milan, on the nuptials of the Archduke Ferdinand, with the Princess of Modena; and this finished the dramatic labours of the bard. His other poetical works, which are very numerous, are all replete with elegance, and every beauty of numbers which the language of Italy so sweetly supplies. Of his prose writings, the extracts from Aristotle's Poetics, and the Ars Poetica of Horace, are the principal. In all his writings the principles of religion and morality are all so chastely preserved, that the extreme of delicacy, the utmost vein: of prudery cannot find a sentiment to offend or alarm; and his private life corresponded well with his writings, as he was always found prompt to discourage all tendency to license, to show himself the avowed enemy of disrespect to the ordinances of morality and religion.

His debut, however, at the Concert Spirituel, in the first concerto of his master, was by no means successful ; but not discouraged by this failure, he shortly after performed his concerto in A major, in which he gained great applause. For ten years Jarnowick was in great favour with the public. The charactéristics of his style were purity, precision, and elegance, but he failed in producing a vigorous tone, in sensibility of expression, und above all, in his cadences. Being obliged to quit France, Jarnowick was succeeded by Viotti, whose superior talents soon completely eclipsed those of his predecessor. Jarnowick was engaged as leader at the chapel of the Prince Royal of Prussia. He published at Paris seven symphonies and nine concertos for his instrument. 'Two amusing anecdotes are related of him. Being at Lyons, he announced a concert at six francs."", 'Finding that no one came, he determined to revenge himself on the avarice of the Lyonnois; in consequence, he postponed his concert till the next day, and then announced it at three francs aticket.

Being one day at Bailleux’s, an editor and music seller, Jarnowick accidentally broke a pane of glass.', 'Succeeding tolerably in this undertaking, he was now enabled to place his two eldest sons, Leopoldo and the subject of this memoir, at a small grammar school, where the latter soon displayed that talent and enthusiasm for poetry, which so eminently distinguished his after life. ‘ Before he was yet ten years old,’ says his biographer Dr. Burney, ‘he had the power of making verses extempore on any subject, and it was no unusual sight to see his father’s porch surrounded in the evening, after school hours, by admiring groups listening to the poesy of a child. During one of these tuneful fits, when Pietro was in his happiest mood, the cvlebrated lawyer and critic, Gravina, happened to pass by his father’s door, and was no less struck with the youth of the poet, than with the softness, yet brilliancy of his verse, the smoothness of his measure, and the sprightliness of his wit, whieh he employed, all’ improvvista, upon the people and objects that surrounded him. Drawing near, Gravina expressed his admiration, and offered him some money; the firm but polite refusal of his donation increased his admiration for the little bard, and he instantly formed the resolution of adopting him as his son. Pleased with this idea, he instantly solicited the consent of his parents ; and as there was nothing humiliating, nothing unkind, in his proposal, Felice gladly complied. The next morning Pietro was consigned to the care and patronage of Gravina, who changed his name to Metastasio, as Meragracc (mutatio) seemed at once to include his family appellation and his situation as an adopted child.']",Jarnowick,Q1526160,person,Q123482537,,0,0,0,1,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau. The second work It may be remarked as a singular thing, that the first opera played in France was composed and performed by churchmen; the words were by the Abbé Perrin, the music by Lambert, the organist of Saint Honoré, and all the singers were chosen from the various parishes. Until the establishment of the Conservatoire, during the revolution, there was no other singing school in France than those in the cathedrals, in which sacred buildings the theatrical rehearsals always took place.', 'At the next service, instead of the beautiful harmonies to which they were uccustomed, nothing was heard but a confusion of indistinct sounds, in fact, an assemblage of the most discordant notes, and a melange of squeaking and msupportable noises. The organist’s intention was apparent, and it was supposed this folly could not last long ; but a month passed, and still this frightful uproar continued. At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.', 'Rameau was in despair, and thought to renounce the theatre. But the public recovered from their prejudice, aad although the success of Hippolyte and Arcie has never eyualled its merit, it was enough to shew the mnsician how wrong he would be to abandon an object half gained.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation.

Something indeed there is much deeper than this—something which no man better than Wagner knows must make its way.; but the process will be slowat least in England—for art must cease to be fashionable before its real value can be gauged, and Opera in this country has not yet become National. The truth cannot be disguised that the Teutonic element in the house had a marvellous effect in teaching the audience that “‘ Lohengrin ” was not to be judged by the ordinary standard; so when the usual round of applause was given for the favourite singers on their entrance and the boisterous marks of approbation burst forth after an effective morceau, a very decided “‘ hush ” convinced the astonished Opera habitués that the vocalists must be considered as secondary to the work they were interpreting, and that any congratulations to individual performers must be reserved for the fall of the curtain. Thus far then has Wagner influenced us for good; and whatever may be the ultimate fate of his works in England, there can be little doubt of the truth of his conviction that the composer has a higher mission than that of administering to the frivolous taste of a frivolous audience. “Lohengrin? must not be accepted as the latest emThere may beand probably is—as much difference between ‘‘ Lohengrin ” and the ‘“* Ring des Niebeliingen ” (which has not yet been heard), as there is between ‘Der Fliegende Hollander ” and Lohengrin.” Wagner’s books must be consulted by all who wish to trace the growth of the idea which has ruled his artistic life; but the result of his philosophy may be found in his Operas, and so progressively developed as to convince even those who disagree with him of the singleness of purpose with which he has worked. Some feeling of disappointment may be widely felt when we are told that the “‘ art work of the future’ is to be based upon mythical legends, and that consequently ‘ Lohengrin” ‘*the type of the sole, real classical subject,” and Elsa, ‘‘woman—woman, as not previously understood,” should be characters which never could have had any real existence; but those who would judge Wagner are bound to come into court with an unbiassed mind; and when we say that for five and twenty years the Opera now submitted to our notice has been gradually rising in public estimation; that it has been played to enthusiastic audiences not only in Germany, but at Bologna, Florence and in the United States, there can be little doubt that it contains within it an element of vitality which cannot fail to preserve it even in the most uncongenial atmosphere.', 'Strauss and his followers.

By Orlando Steed. By the title-page we perceive that this is a lecture delivered at the Town Hall, Sudbury, and we can conscientiously say that were most of the lectures we are compelled to listen to only half as thoughtful and earnest, there would be little need for. the addition of those “illustrations ” without which such discourses are considered in the present day to offer no attraction to the general public. Mr. Steed, although a conscientious artist, is evidently not a musical fanatic, for he wisely commences his address by ing upon his hearers the necessity of enlarging the mind by a study of all arts, in order to work reverently and seriously in any one. “ Not long ago,” he says “ Mr. Ella tells us, at a discussion upon Musical Education at the Society of Arts, painter, a Royal Academician, who had received_his education gratuitously, repudiated the idea of State aid for music on the ground that it was not worthy of being called an art at all. This want of comprehensiveness in those who are considered to belong to the educated classes was doubtless the cause of Channing's pregnant query, ‘Did you ever know a senior wrangler who wasn’t a fool?’ which conveys the incontrovertible truth that exclusive or undue devotion to any kind of study, however legitimate or beneficial, cannot but cramp the powers of the intellect and narrow the sympathies of the mind.” This is indeed true; and were it not for the firm belief a real lover of his art has in what Mr. Steed calls the “moral influence” of muzic, the chance would be small of ita eventually making its way through the mist of ignorance which surrounds it. Pursuing his subject logically, illustrating his positions with much acuteness, and occasionally in most felicitous language, our author very ably proves that music is of all arts most spontaneous, the germs of vocal music, indeed, being inseparable from articulation. “I must repeat,” he says, “that while the organs for the production of effects upon the ear are innate to man, he has to go out of himself, as it were, to obtain the means of appealing tothe eye. Poetry and vocal music are born with him ; architecture, painting and sculpture, can only be practised when he has found out the use of tools.” We regret that we have not space to follow Mr. Steed through the principal points of his very able lecture, but we cannot refrain from quoting some of his remarks respecting those who should be employed. as instructors of youthful pupils, because we are certain that so much misapprehension exists upon this matter that the sooner the truth is spoken the better. “The custom,” he says, “of having incompetent teachers for the young, in the hope that a more capable and expensive one will be able to put things right by and by, is another frequent cause for want of success. The rudiments ofthe art, unless correctly acquired at first, are rarely learnt at all. A bad position of the hands, and numberless other faults, if long persisted in, \x0c will stick to a pupil in spite of all the efforts of after years.” And, speaking of eminent solo performers being engaged as ‘ he writes thus :—“ Great players, independently of their disinclination, are seldom possessed of the requisite qualifications for jeaching beginners of only average talent; _« « « they can hardly be expected to sacrifice the maintenance of their executive proficiency, and their study of the higher branches of the art, in order to make themselves acquainted with the best method of teaching children their notes, and of arousing their dormant sensibilities.” Pre«cisely; bat the delusion that-they will do so is so common that it will require many years to root it out, especially with those parents and guardians who are themselves utterly ignorant of the subject for which they seek instruction. Meanwhile, however, it is good that the question should be ventilated whenever an opportunity arises ; and Mr. Steed deserves every credit for the manner in which he hes boldly come forward to challenge this, as well as many othér conventional shams, connected with the art.""]",Stewart,Q218254,person,Q2801971,Q2801971,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

Soon after, Rossini arose, and in the delight and rapture with which he was hailed there is nothing surprising. In him was found a gentleman who could be equally long, equally loud, and equally astounding with any German to be named—-one who if he had not so much fire as Mozart, had more smoke, and whose operas, from their novelty, for novel they. certainly were to the Italians, must have ‘seemed calculated to restore to them the rank which they had lost. In the second place, no one ever wrote so little for his art and so much for the singer as Rossini; this I take to be the great secret of his success.

The song is evenly, steadily sing,—every note is firm,—the flow of melody is liquid and unimpeded, —and the effect is charming. Mario loves to dress his characters in a new style; he rejoices in new-fashioned wigs, and wonderful coats and boots. We wish, as we have often said, that he would attempt a little acting.

Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

Sivori of what, at the mildest, must be termed piracy; and M. Sivori says not a word, either in refutation or extenuation of that of which he is accused. This is hardly what we ought to expect from one accomplished artist to another, and leaves, in our mind, an impression any thing but favourable to M. Sivori. This is the more disagreeable to us, as we openly profess ourselves friends and admirers of both parties; and though we must confess a preference for the style and execution of M. Ernst, whom we look upon as the greatest violinist since Paganini, yet we have so lofty an opinion of the abilities of M. Sivori, that we are painfully jealous of his good name.

Seeing that at the Royal Academy of Music every effort has been made to found free scholarships, that many already exist there, and that one more has just been presented to the Institution by Sir Francis Goldsmid, we are at a loss to understand why it was said by the Duke of Edinburgh that the “ modes of proceeding” in the two Academies are “ perfectly distinct.” With a firm reliance, however, that there is ample room in the metropolis for both schools, it is satisfactory to find that a bond of union has been established between them by the appointment of an artist, as Principal, at South Kensington, who has so deep an interest in the welfare of what may be termed the parent Institution in Tenterden Street.', 'WE should like to ask those whe have interested themselves in a subject lately ventilated in our columns whether, in parliamentary language, they have had their “attention called” to a pamphlet, recently published, entitled ‘‘ Degrees and ‘degrees’.” If not, we can conscientiously recommend it for perusal.

Earl Dudley, who had kindly granted the use of his house for the meeting, occupied the chair, and in presenting the testimonial made a most eloquent speech, in which he spoke in the highest terms of Sir Julius, and made many graceful allusions to the estimation he was held in by the most eminent artists, and the popularity obtained by his innumerable compositions, especially alluding to the honour conferred upon him by Her Majesty. Sir Julius Benedict, in returning thanks, said :— I cannot find adequate words to express the feelings that come upon me at thismoment.

The testimonial, which was universally admired, consists of an ornamental silver table service, comprising a centre ornament, pair of candelabra, and dessert stands. The centre ornament, bearing eight branches and glass tazzas for flower decoration, is surmounted by the figure of Apollo (a copy of the celebrated statue in the British Museum), and supports on its base figures of St. Cecilia and Sappho. The inscription is as follows :—"" Presented to Sir Julius Benedict, Kt., at Dudley House, on the 19th of May, 1875, by a large circle of amateurs and artists—the Earl of Dudley, president—in appreciation of his labours for forty years for the advancement of art, and as a token of their esteem.” On the reverse are engraved Sir Julius Benedict’s arms and the various decorations which have been conferred upon him. The candelabra, each of which carries seven candles, are designed strictly in accord with the centrepiece; they are enriched with reliefs of suitable subjects, viz.: Orpheus releasing Eurydice from the infernal regions, Ulysses charmed by the Sirens, Orpheus playing to the wild animals, and Pan leading a dance of wood nymphs.

If her voice has lost some of its former flexibility, she still is unapproachable in her own line, and her addition to the company gave it a completeness unknown for too long a period. Her reception in Norma, the first opera in which she played this year, was most triumphant. The Celtic priestess is peculiarly her own—an exhibition of energetic passion, which, on the Italian stage, we should in vain look for elsewhere. Why should we dwell on Lablache and Persiani? Who is not so familiar with the prince of basses and of vis comica, with the most delicate and florid of sopranos, as to render all comment on them totally unnecessary ? The new operas produced this season have been much more successful than usual. Adelia poor thing as it was—proved a failure certainly ; but Don Pasquale has been fortunate, and Linda di Chamounit has wrested praise even from those who have ever been most determined in their hatred of Donizetti. Certainly Don Pasquale did not produce that furore which we are taught was the result of its performance at Paris; excellent as Lablache was, we have seen him to more advantage in other pieces; but there were many things (the serenade, for instance) in the opera which will alwavs win mobapplause. Nor let us omit the performance of Grisias the Lady Norina in Pasquale, which was one of the most admirable specimens of comic talent ever seen on any stage. The simple and touching style of Linda di Chamouni gave it a character unusual in the works of its composer.', ""She talked and laughed with us, adding: ‘Si vous vouligz me-débarrasser de cette machine, c'est cet abominable Due de Brunswick qui vient de me lapportex,’ and so saying, threw a colossal bouquet at me, which I caught.

Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', 'Carissimi . flourished. -- 1609 Sarti ....... born .... 1730 Allegri .. . ditto .... 1629 Sacehini.... ditto .... 1735 ‘Stradella es ditto eee» 1650 Anfossi .... ditto .... 1736 Scarlatti A.. ditto ....:1680 Traetta .... ditto .... 1731 Porpora .... born .... 1685 Paisiello ... ditto .... 1741 Marcello ... ditto .... 1626 Zingarelli .. ditto .... 1752 .

Almost all receive a crown of immortality from their contemporaries, but there are few who conquer the indifference of succeeding generations. Lully’s productions were listened to nearly a century after his death; but Rameau, though not less celebrated, did not enjoy the same good fortune, A few years after Rameaun’s death, Gluck and Piccini accomplished a great musical revolution, which opened a new era in French music, for I consider Gluck a French composer, although he was a Germap by birth; his works, composed in France, bear very little resemblance to the Italian or German school; on the contrary they possess dramatic qualities which are the essence of the French school, and the germ of which might be discovered, although developed with less genius and talent, in the works of Lully and Rameau. A century has now elapsed since Rameaushone with unparallelled glory; besides his theoretical and instrumental productions, he composed for the theatre Hippolyte et Arcie, Les Indes galuntes, Castor et Polluz, Les Talnes Lyriques, et Dardanus ; he was the oracle of the learned who believed in his supremacy, the idol of the public, the favorite of the court, the greatest musician of his time (that is, in France, be it understood).

It is with music as with certain mysteries; let us adore it, and humble ourselves before it ; let us enjoy it and not attempt to analyze it. ; Rameau had the rare and perhaps unique privilege of being a great theoretician and also a great composer.

The losses his accounts shew are sufficient to preclude our lending any credence to rumours respecting the profit or loss of the concern ; but this is not the place to enter upon this subject. ‘We are still more confirmed in our belief that the amuse- ments of the King’ s Theatre are furnished at too dear a rate, although the fact of. the constant loss to the proprietors presents a paradox which appears irreconcileable with that: opinion.', 'tradesmen’s bills, performers’ engagements, and other demands to which I was” liable during the season, and which Benelli had taken upon himself.” \x0c SEVEN YEARS OF THE KING’S THEATRE. 105 The season of 1824 exhibited that superfluous engagement of talent which must have contributed to bring on the distresses that forced Benelli to fly, and assisted mainly in heaping ruin on the head of Mr. Ebers and the creditors of the theatre. Benelli’s defection involved him in immense losses, and what was quite as bad, numberless law-suits—and the only remedy that presented itself to his mind was to embark again in the management. We have understood from good authority that the account against Benelli, fairly made up, amounted to not less than £80,000, a very great portion of which was left unpaid. But even under the complicated embarrassments thus produced, Mr. Ebers’ mind bore up, for he sums up his narrative by saying_ “Thave, fortunately, a mental and physical temperament which does not allow ine to be easily cast down, but at this time | almost quailed.” The opening of the theatre was thus delayed till February 12 (1825), when a new obstacle presented itself in the order of the Lord Chamberlain to have the safety of the building assured by a survey, before the admission of the public. This was overwhelming—but even this the same elasticity of mindsurmounted. It is clear Mr. Ebers was now playing for the most desperate of all stakes—namely, striving to avert the ruin as long as it was possible, for redeniption must have been, to the mind of the most sanguine, perfectly. hopeless. | The alterations took two months, and cost nearly five thousand pounds.

The first of them entitled La Punition, was producedat the Theatre Feydeau, on the 23rd of February, and was not successful. La Prisonniere, another comic opera in one act, of which Boieldieu had written the greater part, had a better fate: this work was plaved at the Theatre Montausier, on the 12th of September of the same year. These two operas, and also two odes to Anacreon set to the Greek text, are the only fruits of our author's pen in the year 1799. The catalogue which mentions these two last pieces, points them out as unique copies."", 'At the same time that Cherubini wrote all those pieces in a light and elegant style, he composed Ledoiska, a large work, in three acis, which was represented at the Theatre Feydeau, on the 18th of July, 1791. This opera, the first basis of the reputation of its author on the French stage, offers the most perfect contrast of manner and thought with the Italian productions of the same artist. A single piece, the air of Warbel, Voyez la belle besogne, recalls the comic style of the time when it was written; the rest is of an energy, such as the genius of Cherubini had at that time given no indication of. A struggle was going on between the comic opera of the Salle Favartand that of the Rue Feydeau; in this conflict of interests the managers of the two theatres took into their heads the foolish notion of doing each other a mutual injury, by bringing out the same pieces. Kreutzer gave Paul et Virginie, at the Theatre Favart. Feydeau asked Lesueur tor an opera of the same title. Cherubini had his Lodoiska brought out at this theatre; and less than a month after they plaved it at the Favart.', 'Théatre de L’Odeon.—A new opera has been produced here, entitled, Charles V. et Dugueselin, the music of which is the joint production of two young candidates for public favour, MM. Gilbert and Guiraud, both of whom have lately obtained the first prize for composition at the Institute. The nmusic possesses much that is of a superior character, but unfortunately the poet had furnished them with but few situations of interest, and few opportunities for concerted pieces. Beyond chorusses, airs, and couplets, nothing was given them to set to music; and yet, several of these couplets are delightfully rendered. An air sung by Leon, with a chorus accompaniment, and another to the words Si j’étais Roi, were warmly encored.']",Boieldieu,Q109875,person,Q57616815,Q57616815,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses.

Almost all receive a crown of immortality from their contemporaries, but there are few who conquer the indifference of succeeding generations. Lully’s productions were listened to nearly a century after his death; but Rameau, though not less celebrated, did not enjoy the same good fortune, A few years after Rameaun’s death, Gluck and Piccini accomplished a great musical revolution, which opened a new era in French music, for I consider Gluck a French composer, although he was a Germap by birth; his works, composed in France, bear very little resemblance to the Italian or German school; on the contrary they possess dramatic qualities which are the essence of the French school, and the germ of which might be discovered, although developed with less genius and talent, in the works of Lully and Rameau. A century has now elapsed since Rameaushone with unparallelled glory; besides his theoretical and instrumental productions, he composed for the theatre Hippolyte et Arcie, Les Indes galuntes, Castor et Polluz, Les Talnes Lyriques, et Dardanus ; he was the oracle of the learned who believed in his supremacy, the idol of the public, the favorite of the court, the greatest musician of his time (that is, in France, be it understood).

Poetry may be said to be eternal ; it addresses itself to a comprehension which varies but little, in spite of the infinence of time and circumstance ; painting and sculpture have a fixed basis: they are an imitation of nature, whose models do not change; the men of the time of Apelles and Praziteles were the.', 'The eastern nations understand nothing of our music, and theirs is perfectly unintelligible to our European ears; but place before them a picture or a statue and they will comprehend it.

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning.

Soon after, Rossini arose, and in the delight and rapture with which he was hailed there is nothing surprising. In him was found a gentleman who could be equally long, equally loud, and equally astounding with any German to be named—-one who if he had not so much fire as Mozart, had more smoke, and whose operas, from their novelty, for novel they. certainly were to the Italians, must have ‘seemed calculated to restore to them the rank which they had lost. In the second place, no one ever wrote so little for his art and so much for the singer as Rossini; this I take to be the great secret of his success. When we hear works of the highest class we seldom think of the composer; our minds are filled with the _characters he brings before us, or the 1 images which are raised up by his power, and -it is only when the charm is ended that our attention is turned towards the. magician who has created it.', '""Tsar «there is luck in all things” is a trath which all are ready to admit; and the freaks of the blind Goddess are constantly the subjects of our wonder and admiration.

But I have too much sense of propriety to shew my reading by trespassing so much on your valuable space, and therefore I shall content myself with glancing at the musicians; indeed it will be sufficient for my purpose if I select him whose name stands at the head of this letter. How common it is to hear Rossini called “ the child of Fore tune”—the spoiled child, according to some—“ the most lucky fellow” that ever put pen to music paper, and other epithets which shew the sensation produced by his brilliant and extraordinary career. Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

The peculiar character of Albinoni’s style fitted him more for the composition of sacred than of dramatic music; it was distinguished by a certain coldness and rigidity, but ill-suited to the warmth and vigour of scenic effect—yet, by one of those strange contradictions, not less frequent among artists than amongst less enlightened men, he preferred that career, in which he was the least likely to shine—nevertheless his operas, redeemed by the purity and science they displayed, almost all succeeded.']",Albinoni,Q174606,person,Q112520804,Q112520804,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

Sivori of what, at the mildest, must be termed piracy; and M. Sivori says not a word, either in refutation or extenuation of that of which he is accused. This is hardly what we ought to expect from one accomplished artist to another, and leaves, in our mind, an impression any thing but favourable to M. Sivori.

Ernst, whom we look upon as the greatest violinist since Paganini, yet we have so lofty an opinion of the abilities of M. Sivori, that we are painfully jealous of his good name.

Her personal charms are unimpaired, and her acknowledgements of the enthusiastic reception with which she was greeted, were most graceful. Her vocal powers are certainly changed; her voice is not what it was, but it is still shows the original proportions of nature and art. She sung “ Batti, Batti,” with the same sweetness and delicacy, and ‘* Non temer,” with the same archness as ever, and it seems pro_ bable her voice may be restored by her native climate.', ""Ay monast the chang eS of the time, we have had frequent occasion toremark, that there is none mofesingular orcomplete than the taste for rapid Italian comic compositions. In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking.

He was an exquisite violinist, an excellent master, and an original composer. In every thing he undertook to perfect, he left the marks ofan inventive imagination, and a reflective mind. By enlarging the strings of the violin, which till then had been thin and weak, and: by lengthening the bow, he softened its tone, which is naturally harsh, and by improving the position of the bow, by hastening or slackening its motion, and by regulating the pressure, he succeeded in producing a peculiarly sweet and fine tone. His compositions are distinguished by that purity and unity of thought, that exquisite simplicity,.that soft anddelicate pathos, so delightful to persons of feeling, yet so difficult to describe. He was a strong example of the truth of this precept of Horace : “ Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem.,’ His natural modesty at first retarded him in his career, only that he might afterwards raise himself the more rapidly to that pitch of exquisite expression which characterizes his compositions, and which is compared by some to the muse of Petrarch, of whose poetry Tartini was a great admirer. Hence we may believe the assertion, that it was his custom, before he began to compose, to read and meditate upon some one of the sonnets of that poet, in order to illumine his imagination with the pure flame of his Platonic and sublime passion.* ‘There are some who accuse him of being too sparing in his accompaniments, and certainly if his compositions are compared with others, the difference in this respect is but too visible ; but this defect-soon disappears, when we reflect that the delicate colouring of the style of Tartini would.', 'This delicacy of organization, was in Mr. Viotti, accompanied by remarkably quick intellects, and a correct judgment. Nearly the whole of his life was passed in the seciety of literary, accomplished, elegant people, and from the conversation and correspondence of these, his mind acquired a strength and refinement, which are commonly denied to the studious recluse. . Amongst his intimate friends, he could name some of the most distinguished characters of the age in which he lived, and with the great he associated on terms of unoffending equality and unassuming freedom, for he was neither unconscious of his own rank, as a man of rare talent, nor forgetful. of theirs, as persons of high birth and splendid fortune. In all his transactions, his conduct was regulated by the strictest notions of honour; his opinions were liberal, his feelings benevolent, and his manners those of a perfect gentleman. . : Of the compositions of Viotti, those we would principally 1 recommend to the attention of the amateurs of instrumental music, are his concertos in G, in A minor, in D and in E minor, The theme of the concertoin D, is in the highest degree brilliant, but it must not be forgotten that it is taken from a trio of Pugnani in E flat.

What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'In our last volume* we gave a sketch of the music at the Winter Theatres, which exhausted nearly all the novelty produced during the year. Just before the close of Covent Garden “‘ Carron side,” an opera by Signor Liverati, was produced with success. It was chiefly written in imitation of Scotch Melody, and the airs were generally pleasing. One trio, in which the Italian taste of the composer manifested itself, had great merit, At Drury-lane, Artaxerxes was revived, Madame Fearon taking the part of Mandane, and Shakespeare’s T. aming of the Shrew was given with much music, for the purpose of introducing Miss Ayton as Catharine. She sustained the character in a manner to add much‘to her reputation for ability asan actress. ‘Thus things have proceeded much in the old train; but it is singular, that while upon every occasion when the appearance of a new singer or any other cause compels a recurrence. to legitimate opera, Artaxerxes is resuscitated—it is singular that no further attempt should be made to try the taste of that public, which for more than half a century has run after this the single specimen of ‘the lyric drama we possess, by a sound and regular composition of the same species. Judgment pronounces upon the propriety, and the town approves in the only example we have. Yet strange to say no advance towards giving the country a regular opera is Vol, 9, page 351.', 'On Thursday, Miss Hughes took her benefit, and a new opera called Nadir and Zuleika was produced ; the music _partly selected, partly composed by Mr. Horn. Of course, the piece is of an eastern character. The music is light, pretty, and well suited to the sentiment. The plot is rather extravagant ; turning upon no less than the opium day-dream of Nadir, a young gentleman who has expressed a wish to become acquainted with the lovely houris; or black-eyed beauties of Mahomet’s heaven; and this being overheard by Zuleika, a young lady who imagines that her charms are sufficient to ensure him a terrestrial paradise, she resents his conduct by dosing him and his servant with opium ; and then gets up a scene during his bewilderment, which causes him to believe, that he really has thrown off ‘ this mortal coil,’ and is in possession of his wish. A number of droll circumstances and situations arise, which we have not space to dwell on: suffice it to say, that it is a lively operetta of the Abon Hassan’ species ; and, like that piece, has an admirable part for Placie, which he makes the most of; indeed, he is extremely droll, and kept the house in constant laughter. The overture is composed by Fetis, a person who stands high as a critic in Paris, and editor of a musical journal. Mr. Horn has’ likewise used the chorus Tacete non temete, by Mercadante, as found in his opera Le Nonne de Gamache. It is also introduced in Elise e Claudio. To this he has added a second subject skilfully, and, we think, has increased its effect. A ballad, founded on a Swiss air, sung by Miss Hughes, is a charming little gem; and was executed by her extremely well, and deservingly encored. She had likewise a bravura, with a corno and clarinette accompaniment. The former instrument was clumsily managed, the latter had not enough to do; but Herwig never fails in his part; and what he had to play was perfect. We do not admire this bravura ; the divisions are common-place, and such as we have heard five hundred times with all the clap-traps and gallery-delights commonly used; but Horn has instrumented the song with his usual ability. Jones has two songs, both good ; the last a very beautiful air, tov chaste perhaps to please the multitude; but it comes in a bad situation, directly after the former noisy song. Ano_ ther place should be found, or dialogue introduced between the two. The choruses are pleasing, and they sang, particularly the ladies, admirably. Richings sustained the character of Vivienne, a French officer brought into the east we really forget for what purpose. He acted naturally, and there was nothing in the concerted music beyond his capability. After the opera, the excellent piece of ‘Ways and Means’ was performed; and between the acts the band played out of the book number siz, which the house immediately recognized, and hissed most profoundly. Horn’s pretty ballad, the Mermaid’s Cave, followed, sung by Miss Hughes, and accompanied by himself; it was received with its usual éclaé. The opera of John of Paris concluded the evening, which was done much more perfectly than before.—-(New York Mirror.)']",Mercadante,Q313980,person,Q3854823,Q3854823,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

It was Mendelssohn’s birthday, and his friends combined to keep it with due festivity. Moscheles must describe the revels :—‘‘ The proceedings were opened wifh a capital comic scene between two ladies’ maids, acted, in the Frankfort dialect, by Cécile (Madame Mendelssohn) andher sister. Then came a Charade on the word ‘ Gewandhaus,’ Joachim, adorned with a fantastic wig, @ la Paganini, played a hare-brained Impromptu on the G string. The syllable ‘wand’. was represented by the Pyramus and Thisbe wall-scene from the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ;’ for ‘haus’ Charlotte (Mrs. Moscheles) acted a scene she had written herself, in which she is discovered knitting a blue stocking, and soliloquizing on the foibles of female authoresses, advising them to attend to their domestic duties.', 'Medee was for Cherubini one of his greatest triumphs as a dramatic composer. In this work there certainly exists prosyness, which spoils the dramatic effect, as in the air of Creen, repeated usque ad nauseam to these verses :— “ C’est d vous a trembler, femme impie et barbare! Créon, de vos forfaits, arretera le cours, Fremissez des tourments que l’enfer vous prepare: Ce jour sera le dernier de vos jours.” But this fault is made up for by noble and touch.ing melodies, such as the air Elvigne pour jamais d@’ une epouse cruelle; and, above all, by that of iMedee,—‘** Vous voyez de vos fils la mere infortunee ;’’ by the fine scene in the temple, in the second act; and by the energy of the two duets of Medee and Jason. With respect to the effects of instrumentation and the merit of the working, Cherubini shews himself so much superior, that the first rank amongst the then existing composers could not be refused him, by those, even, who had more sympathy for less powerful music, and which could be more casily understoad.', 'Théatre de L’Odeon.—A new opera has been produced here, entitled, Charles V. et Dugueselin, the music of which is the joint production of two young candidates for public favour, MM. Gilbert and Guiraud, both of whom have lately obtained the first prize for composition at the Institute. The nmusic possesses much that is of a superior character, but unfortunately the poet had furnished them with but few situations of interest, and few opportunities for concerted pieces.

Already has been suggested that every work of art is a subjective picture, a confession of the joys or sorrows of him who produces it. In this respect, an unentitled piece of music somewhat resembles a landscape or a pastoral poem, which possesses a personal character, in so far as it may express the feelings of the author, beyond the positive facts of which it is a statement, namely, that there is a tree to the right hand, or a brook to the left, or a hill in the distance, or the warm glow of a summer heaven pervading the whole. To-day, one may regard these objects with grateful devotion; to-morrow, with regret for the companion with whom he once viewed them; again, in the overflow of animal spirits: springing from health or from some fortune apart from the scene; at another time, in the indifference of a purposeless hour; anon, in the despair of frustrated endeavour.

It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal. It thus appears that the Duke increased the strength of his choir, not by engaging new members, but by obtaining the assistance of the King’s choristers.', 'It is known that Doctor Burney wrote an account of the Commemoration of Handel: on this subject his memorialist is more diffuse than on most others which relate alone to music.

Andrea Lucchesi was born at Malta, in the Venetian States, in 1741. He however. received his first: instructions. in music at Naples, where he studied sacred composition under 11 Padre Poalucci, the scholar of the Padre Martini, and dramatic under Cochi. He afterwards received further instructions from Saratelli, the predecessor of Galuppi;, as Chapel Master of St. Mark at Venice. In 1771, Lucchesi went with acompany of opera singers _to Bonn, and entered the service of the Elector of Cologne as Chapel Master, with a salary of 1000 florins.. He excelled greatly as a performer on the organ, which instrument he had studied much in Italy. In composition his manner was light, animated, and agreeable, whilst the perfect purity of his style was very remarkable. In his church music he. was however scrupulously exact as torhythm. His operas are “ L’Isola della Fortuna,” at’ Venice, 1765; Jl Marito geloso, at Venice, and “ Le Donne sempre donne,” 1766; “Jl Matrimonio per astusia,’ A771; “Il Giocatore amoroso,” an interlude for two persons.

He left one son, Guiseppe Ant. Bernabei, who inherited both his place and his talent—indeed +he even ‘surpassed him i melody and modulation, as his life was long enough to see a great relaxation in the rigour of the early rules of counterpoint.— Guiseppe was honoured by the Elector of Bavaria with the title of “Aulic Counsellor.” He published several sacred compositions for the church, replete with the purest musical science, and died in 1752, at the age of 89. Several of his. works: are still preserved, and amongst the rest one entitled “Orpheus Ecclesiasticus,” which is very highly valued.. In spite of the ascendancy which compositions for the church obtained over every other in the Roman school, there were yet some attempts made at this time in behalf of theatrical music, which, if it did not promise such distinguished honours as the church to its votaries, at least presented a spacious field open to their efforts, and one which would keep them constantly before the eyes of their country. The composer now highest in dramatic composition was Angelo Cec- chini, born at Rome in 1600; but, whatever might be his: merit, - the opinions then prevalent would not allow of his becoming chapel master at any of the churches, and he was only pr incipal ‘musician to one of the highest Roman Dukes. His first production was a pastoral (a piece much in vogue at that time in Italy) ; it was entitled “ Z’ Ercoleo Ar dire,’ ’ and although it did not display as much talent as has since appeared i in the works of his followers in the same style, yet it gained him a great deal of applause. ‘He afterwards produced an opera, entitled “ La Sincerita trionphante,” which succeeded still better ‘tan the last : piece.']",Bishop,Q1200639,person,Q1158188,Q1158188,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.', ""the general effect. . At Cambridge, Madame Pasta and Miss Stephens completely carried away the palm. Rossini attracted great attention by his humour, but not by his singing, which had neither the finish nor the excellence which was anticipated. .The sober majesty and expression of Pasta, and the simplicity of Stephens, won all hearts, while Madame Catalani made no strong impression (though encored in “ Cease your funning,)” except in “ Rule Britannia” and “God save the King.’ Mr. Sapio* was the favourite amongst the male singers. Signor Placci sung very little—no song indeed—and if Mr. Kellner had been so curtailed, the audience would not have complained. Upon the whole, the performance was totally unworthy the patronage, totally unworthy of the place, totally unworthy. the name of a Grand Festival, and ought to be recorded as'a warning. Gentlemen conducting public institutions should be governed by great public principles, and should not put their characters to the hazard, or compromise their judgment by niggardly considerations—and above all, they should engage competent persons to frame the terms.of a contract, which is very liable to evasion. Nothing probably would have startled the gentlemen who engaged with Madame Catalani so much as the knowledge of the practical deception to which they were about to be made the innocent parties..

The ‘Agnus Dei” is a perfect gem. The theme, commenced in octaves by the two soprani, and afterwards joined by the chorus, then given in the minor by the solo voices, and harmonised in the instrumentation, came as a veritable inspiration upon the audience, and at its conclusion the applause could scarcely be subdued, even by..the repetition of the movement. Beautiful also is the ‘“ Lachrymosa,” the effect of the plaintive notes of the mezzo-soprano against the bass solo, giving a depth of expression to the words almost in..describable, These two movements are perhaps amongst the purest specimens of spontaneous writing in the work; but we must also instance the “ Recordare,” the bass-solo “Confutatis” (although we can scarcely reconcile ourselves to the sequence of fifths which accompanies it), and the final “ Libera me;”” but in naming these we need scarcely say that they comprise only a small portion of the many charming pieces in a composition which cannot fail to take a permanent place amongst the accepted works of modern composers. The solo parts were admirably sustained by Madame Stolz, Madame Waldmann, ‘Signor Masini, and Signor Medini, the first named lady displaying a clear and liquid soprano voice, eminently suited to give the utmost effect to Signor Verdi’s music. Madame Wald‘mann was also in every respect highly satisfactory, and both tenor and bass acquitted themselves of their arduous task most successfully, Signor Masini, however, occasionally indulging in a tremolo which much detracted from the effect of his really beautiful voice. The choruses were finely sung by the Royal Albert Hall Choir (which had been previously well drilled by Mr. Barnby), and the orchestra was everything that could be desired. Signor Verdi, who conducted, received quite an ovation, and was evidently much pleased with the manner in which his music had been prepared. In consequence of the great success of the work, two special representations, at popular prices, were given on the 22nd and 2oth ult.

From the oratorios of Handel himself, many such instances might be adduced, but we content ourselves with referring only to a point or two in Judas Maccabeus. For instance, the eherusses ‘Hear us, lerd.’ and the final Hallelujah,’ are unquestionably church music ; but the song “ Sound an alarm.” and the sub:equent chorus ‘* We hear.” cannot be so termed they are simply dramatic compocitiens of the very highest order. {Indecd. in the celebrzted march in this oratorio Hendel appears to be The whole structure of striving to forego his innately ponderous stsle ' in favour of one more suited to the dramatic ne- | For the Introduction we cannot say much ; cessity of the occasion. In Beethoven’s Mount of Olives we find the same principle even more pointedly exemp ified. In one piece the cuntrast of the simple dramatic with the purely ecclesiastical style is remarkable. We refer to the opening aria for the tenor. So long as the text speaks only of the physical sufferings of the Saviour in his character of man, the music is merely, but intensely, dramatic; but the instant supplication becomes the poet’s theme—at the words “Father, lowly bends before thee’’the first character of the music is. changed fer one purely devotional. Again, in the same oratorio, we instantly recognise in the grand recitative of the angels, “ ‘Thus wills Jehovah,” all that sublimity of character which we habitually attribute to church music ; but the trio, “ My soul with rage and fury,”’ and the chorus of soldiers, ‘‘iie came towards this mountuin,” partake nothing of this character. They are grand, impressive, and truthfully dramatic, if you will; but they have not the remotest reference to the metaphysical or the divine.

What would we not give to hear Bennett's interpretation of the work which we but lately spoke of with such sincere enthusiasm—and which is not only admirably suited to his style of execution, but is scarcely inferior in merit to the quartet of Mendelssohn, which was executed on Monday night with such wonderful energy and power!

We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice.

His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses.

Moreover, Rossini, though he may never have read the e says of Lord Bacon, must be instinctively aware of what that great man asserted, with as much eloquence as truth, in regard to popularity: viz., that the multitude worship the rising rather than the se¢- ting sun. Next to Rossini ranks the composer of La Muette de Portici, and Fra Diavolo—creations that will live for ever—creations that place Auber among those, whom fame will not allow to be forgotten; but their greatness has been rather dimmed than lustred, by the subsequent productions of their author.

But, as we believe the word oratorio—” the meaning of which term we imagine ut extremely difficult to limit—misleads many people with vague and uncertain notions of musical character, we think the matter worth a brief discus:ion.” In the first place, whenever sacred music, or an oratorio, is mentioned, we are apt at once mentaliy to refer to the music of Handel as the standar!, and to insist that ail other composers sha‘l write sacred music in his style. his occurs, partly because the ponderous and magnificent stvie of Handel is, without question, more capable than any other of awakening ideas of the subliine, and partly because we have, for more than a century, been accustomed to its association with them. But we must not neglect to remark that this peculiar fitness to sacred purposes which we recognise in the music of Handei arose more frum natural necessity than from any desire on his part to travel out of his usual path for the peculiar iliustration of a peculiar text. In other words, Handel's styte, under all circumstances. for oratorios, for operas, for instrumental pieces. was one and the same."", ""Of Handel's efforts in oratorio we had also a full account ; those gigantic. works, written after he had passed his fifty-third year.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered.

This movement is altogether in the easy yet florid cantabile manner so ‘frequently adopted by this composer. (The subject is well treated through two pages, when a very chantant “‘ Allegro giocoso” com“mences, which is worked upon ina pleasing manner through seven pages. During the whole progress of this movement an effective and elegant melody is retained, which any one accustomed to peruse Mr. Cramer’s works would easily recognize as belonging to his pure and judicious style.

It is effective and brilliant music, full of tune, as is everything from its composer's pen; but the first movement might almost be called absolutely commonplace. The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

As our own course of reading necessarily runs in the same track, we may be allowed to pronounce upon this point with some small share of authority, and we cannot,commend either the matter and the manner too highly. Se a It remains for us only to advert to some of the more novel parts, for it would be alike impossible and useless to attempt a further The first circumstances that claims our notice are the particular effects which were observed. We have already described many of the grander features in our article on the York Festival,* which coincide with the account given by our author. Amongst those which remain, the first was the effect of the trumpet in “ Sound an-alarm,” and Martin Luther's Hymn.” “ The sound of the trumpet, proceeding from nearly the top of the orchestra, appeared as if it descended from the open space of the tower above; and the thrill of awe, not unmingled even with terror, which it produced, was such as we shall not attempt to describe.” oe ee The next is upon the subject of the quantity of base necessary to the foundation of a band. Speaking of the performance of Haydn’s chorus, La Tempesta, Mr. C. says— Bo We were also strengthened in the opinion, that productions of this class of art, and especially of modern art, require more power of bass than has ever yet been concentrated, to create an effect equal to that which entered into the imagination of the composer; since not all the weight of double basses, trombones, &c, bottomed on the diapason‘of the organ, was found sufficient to satisfy the craving of the ear. A similar observation was made with respect to the great Abbey festival of 1791, where the power, nevertheless, was above double that of the York band, and ina more contracted space. We venture, therefore, to hazard: an opinion, grounded on the result of the Abbey meetings, and of ."", '“ When the clond is scattered The rainbow’s glory is fled.” The effect of Mendelssohn’s music on me, is as the effect of the poetry of Martinez de la Rosa, after perusing which, I awake as from a dream to behold the nothingness of reality—to own the infinitude of the shadowy empire of imagination. Perhaps immediately after Mendelssohn, Spohr may take his place as a living composer—though great mannerism and repeated imitations of himself, almost unfit him for a station among such a glorious company. The predominant feature of Spohr’s music is a voluptuous monotony—a luxury indeed, but a vicious one. Oratorio, opera, sinfonia, concerto, quartet, to Spohr are all alike—one and the same thing, with regard to style—no shadow of distinction in character or in the march of thought—like a tide which ever flows—never ebbs. I must confess my prejudice against his operas, in spite of their beauty—in spite of their ingenuity ; they are tiresome, sleepy, unhealthy productionsmacula or pimples—heated excrescences from the feverish and diseased imagination of their author.+ I feel heavy and oppressed while listening to them—always dreaming of lemonade or soda-water — wishing, repeatedly wishing, for the conclusion, in order that the sublimer, because simpler, music of si/ence may refresh my spirit, wearied with tormented and elaborated sound.']",Lortzing,Q154203,person,Q108515006,Q108515006,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

Of course, the piece is of an eastern character. The music is light, pretty, and well suited to the sentiment. The plot is rather extravagant ; turning upon no less than the opium day-dream of Nadir, a young gentleman who has expressed a wish to become acquainted with the lovely houris; or black-eyed beauties of Mahomet’s heaven; and this being overheard by Zuleika, a young lady who imagines that her charms are sufficient to ensure him a terrestrial paradise, she resents his conduct by dosing him and his servant with opium ; and then gets up a scene during his bewilderment, which causes him to believe, that he really has thrown off ‘ this mortal coil,’ and is in possession of his wish. A number of droll circumstances and situations arise, which we have not space to dwell on: suffice it to say, that it is a lively operetta of the Abon Hassan’ species ; and, like that piece, has an admirable part for Placie, which he makes the most of; indeed, he is extremely droll, and kept the house in constant laughter. The overture is composed by Fetis, a person who stands high as a critic in Paris, and editor of a musical journal. Mr. Horn has’ likewise used the chorus Tacete non temete, by Mercadante, as found in his opera Le Nonne de Gamache. It is also introduced in Elise e Claudio. To this he has added a second subject skilfully, and, we think, has increased its effect. A ballad, founded on a Swiss air, sung by Miss Hughes, is a charming little gem; and was executed by her extremely well, and deservingly encored. She had likewise a bravura, with a corno and clarinette accompaniment. The former instrument was clumsily managed, the latter had not enough to do; but Herwig never fails in his part; and what he had to play was perfect.

Horn’s pretty ballad, the Mermaid’s Cave, followed, sung by Miss Hughes, and accompanied by himself; it was received with its usual éclaé. The opera of John of Paris concluded the evening, which was done much more perfectly than before.—-(New York Mirror.)', 'On Thursday, Miss Hughes took her benefit, and a new opera called Nadir and Zuleika was produced ; the music _partly selected, partly composed by Mr. Horn. Of course, the piece is of an eastern character. The music is light, pretty, and well suited to the sentiment. The plot is rather extravagant ; turning upon no less than the opium day-dream of Nadir, a young gentleman who has expressed a wish to become acquainted with the lovely houris; or black-eyed beauties of Mahomet’s heaven; and this being overheard by Zuleika, a young lady who imagines that her charms are sufficient to ensure him a terrestrial paradise, she resents his conduct by dosing him and his servant with opium ; and then gets up a scene during his bewilderment, which causes him to believe, that he really has thrown off ‘ this mortal coil,’ and is in possession of his wish. A number of droll circumstances and situations arise, which we have not space to dwell on: suffice it to say, that it is a lively operetta of the Abon Hassan’ species ; and, like that piece, has an admirable part for Placie, which he makes the most of; indeed, he is extremely droll, and kept the house in constant laughter. The overture is composed by Fetis, a person who stands high as a critic in Paris, and editor of a musical journal. Mr. Horn has’ likewise used the chorus Tacete non temete, by Mercadante, as found in his opera Le Nonne de Gamache. It is also introduced in Elise e Claudio. To this he has added a second subject skilfully, and, we think, has increased its effect. A ballad, founded on a Swiss air, sung by Miss Hughes, is a charming little gem; and was executed by her extremely well, and deservingly encored. She had likewise a bravura, with a corno and clarinette accompaniment. The former instrument was clumsily managed, the latter had not enough to do; but Herwig never fails in his part; and what he had to play was perfect. We do not admire this bravura ; the divisions are common-place, and such as we have heard five hundred times with all the clap-traps and gallery-delights commonly used; but Horn has instrumented the song with his usual ability.

Haydn is not the single instance of a composer who has passed through such a mental process. It signifies nothing to the argument whether the artist be the inventor or only the illustrator of his theme; Shakspeare’s Tempest may be before his mind’s eye when he paints his fanciful. tone-portrait, or a conceit of a storm at sea with its results that never had action outside his own thoughts, or the loss of the Medusa, or any other veritable shipwreck ; and he may amuse himself, if no one else, by making his music wild or tranquil, agitated or serene, according as bad or good weather prevails in his imagination, and as the fears or hopes are paramount of the voyagers. This is not all; without admitting, even to himself, a plot, he is yet a narrator, if only of the thoughts and feelings that live and work within him during his period of composition. The same man will produce a graver work or a gayer, a calmer or a more agitated, a month sooner or later in his life, according to the passions that sway his heart, and be unconscious all the while that he is setting down an autobiography. It is hard to believe, indeed, that any artistic work can be all expressionless, save only a scholastic exercise; nay, perhaps not even this, for the man’s patience or his want of it, his resignation or his eagerness will speak out in the smoothness or roughness of his lines, in the formality or quaintness of his words, in the fluency or angularity of his counterpoint.', 'The symphony by Haydn, is one of the twelve composed for Salomon’s concerts, or the fourth grand, as it would have been well to denominate it ; for all of these deserve to be distinguishe:l from most of his earlier ones.

The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody.

He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction.

In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'AN amateur concert was given at the St. Mark’s Schools, Regent’s-park, on Wednesday evening the 5th ult.

Just before the close of Covent Garden “‘ Carron side,” an opera by Signor Liverati, was produced with success. It was chiefly written in imitation of Scotch Melody, and the airs were generally pleasing. One trio, in which the Italian taste of the composer manifested itself, had great merit, At Drury-lane, Artaxerxes was revived, Madame Fearon taking the part of Mandane, and Shakespeare’s T. aming of the Shrew was given with much music, for the purpose of introducing Miss Ayton as Catharine. She sustained the character in a manner to add much‘to her reputation for ability asan actress. ‘Thus things have proceeded much in the old train; but it is singular, that while upon every occasion when the appearance of a new singer or any other cause compels a recurrence. to legitimate opera, Artaxerxes is resuscitated—it is singular that no further attempt should be made to try the taste of that public, which for more than half a century has run after this the single specimen of ‘the lyric drama we possess, by a sound and regular composition of the same species. Judgment pronounces upon the propriety, and the town approves in the only example we have. Yet strange to say no advance towards giving the country a regular opera is Vol, 9, page 351.', 'To sum up her attributes then—she has a fine sensibility and a just conception—an intonation seldom incorrect—execution perfected and regulated by profound science. Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be. Her recitativo parlante i is far above that of most performers, and we must repeat that her entire manner exhibits the force of sensibility, intellect, and science, in the use of organic powers generally speaking far below those possessed by singers of so high a class. .']",Vestris,Q6696635,person,,,0,0,0,0,QID,1,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

Her reception in Norma, the first opera in which she played this year, was most triumphant. The Celtic priestess is peculiarly her own—an exhibition of energetic passion, which, on the Italian stage, we should in vain look for elsewhere. Why should we dwell on Lablache and Persiani? Who is not so familiar with the prince of basses and of vis comica, with the most delicate and florid of sopranos, as to render all comment on them totally unnecessary ? The new operas produced this season have been much more successful than usual. Adelia poor thing as it was—proved a failure certainly ; but Don Pasquale has been fortunate, and Linda di Chamounit has wrested praise even from those who have ever been most determined in their hatred of Donizetti. Certainly Don Pasquale did not produce that furore which we are taught was the result of its performance at Paris; excellent as Lablache was, we have seen him to more advantage in other pieces; but there were many things (the serenade, for instance) in the opera which will alwavs win mobapplause. Nor let us omit the performance of Grisias the Lady Norina in Pasquale, which was one of the most admirable specimens of comic talent ever seen on any stage.

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred.

The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice?

We are really sorry; but his rude style will never make us recognize his competence in matters of art, any more than the musical feeling ot his compatriots—and to justify this opinion it is only necessary to glance retrospectively at a few facts relative to music in England.” But we must take wind.

Schlesinger, the music vendor, may desire ;—consequently, what M.', 'hard style, but always showing an intelligent appreciation of the dramatic exigencies of the part. In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.']",Graun,Q161208,person,,,0,0,0,0,QID,1,0.9024390243902439,0.8477088948787062,0.8742182070882557

GADE.', 'On Thursday, Miss Hughes took her benefit, and a new opera called Nadir and Zuleika was produced ; the music _partly selected, partly composed by Mr. Horn. Of course, the piece is of an eastern character. The music is light, pretty, and well suited to the sentiment. The plot is rather extravagant ; turning upon no less than the opium day-dream of Nadir, a young gentleman who has expressed a wish to become acquainted with the lovely houris; or black-eyed beauties of Mahomet’s heaven; and this being overheard by Zuleika, a young lady who imagines that her charms are sufficient to ensure him a terrestrial paradise, she resents his conduct by dosing him and his servant with opium ; and then gets up a scene during his bewilderment, which causes him to believe, that he really has thrown off ‘ this mortal coil,’ and is in possession of his wish. A number of droll circumstances and situations arise, which we have not space to dwell on: suffice it to say, that it is a lively operetta of the Abon Hassan’ species ; and, like that piece, has an admirable part for Placie, which he makes the most of; indeed, he is extremely droll, and kept the house in constant laughter. The overture is composed by Fetis, a person who stands high as a critic in Paris, and editor of a musical journal. Mr. Horn has’ likewise used the chorus Tacete non temete, by Mercadante, as found in his opera Le Nonne de Gamache. It is also introduced in Elise e Claudio. To this he has added a second subject skilfully, and, we think, has increased its effect. A ballad, founded on a Swiss air, sung by Miss Hughes, is a charming little gem; and was executed by her extremely well, and deservingly encored. She had likewise a bravura, with a corno and clarinette accompaniment. The former instrument was clumsily managed, the latter had not enough to do; but Herwig never fails in his part; and what he had to play was perfect. We do not admire this bravura ; the divisions are common-place, and such as we have heard five hundred times with all the clap-traps and gallery-delights commonly used; but Horn has instrumented the song with his usual ability. Jones has two songs, both good ; the last a very beautiful air, tov chaste perhaps to please the multitude; but it comes in a bad situation, directly after the former noisy song. Ano_ ther place should be found, or dialogue introduced between the two. The choruses are pleasing, and they sang, particularly the ladies, admirably. Richings sustained the character of Vivienne, a French officer brought into the east we really forget for what purpose. He acted naturally, and there was nothing in the concerted music beyond his capability. After the opera, the excellent piece of ‘Ways and Means’ was performed; and between the acts the band played out of the book number siz, which the house immediately recognized, and hissed most profoundly. Horn’s pretty ballad, the Mermaid’s Cave, followed, sung by Miss Hughes, and accompanied by himself; it was received with its usual éclaé.

Moreover, Rossini, though he may never have read the e says of Lord Bacon, must be instinctively aware of what that great man asserted, with as much eloquence as truth, in regard to popularity: viz., that the multitude worship the rising rather than the se¢- ting sun. Next to Rossini ranks the composer of La Muette de Portici, and Fra Diavolo—creations that will live for ever—creations that place Auber among those, whom fame will not allow to be forgotten; but their greatness has been rather dimmed than lustred, by the subsequent productions of their author.

From the oratorios of Handel himself, many such instances might be adduced, but we content ourselves with referring only to a point or two in Judas Maccabeus. For instance, the eherusses ‘Hear us, lerd.’ and the final Hallelujah,’ are unquestionably church music ; but the song “ Sound an alarm.” and the sub:equent chorus ‘* We hear.” cannot be so termed they are simply dramatic compocitiens of the very highest order. {Indecd. in the celebrzted march in this oratorio Hendel appears to be The whole structure of striving to forego his innately ponderous stsle ' in favour of one more suited to the dramatic ne- | For the Introduction we cannot say much ; cessity of the occasion. In Beethoven’s Mount of Olives we find the same principle even more pointedly exemp ified. In one piece the cuntrast of the simple dramatic with the purely ecclesiastical style is remarkable. We refer to the opening aria for the tenor. So long as the text speaks only of the physical sufferings of the Saviour in his character of man, the music is merely, but intensely, dramatic; but the instant supplication becomes the poet’s theme—at the words “Father, lowly bends before thee’’the first character of the music is. changed fer one purely devotional. Again, in the same oratorio, we instantly recognise in the grand recitative of the angels, “ ‘Thus wills Jehovah,” all that sublimity of character which we habitually attribute to church music ; but the trio, “ My soul with rage and fury,”’ and the chorus of soldiers, ‘‘iie came towards this mountuin,” partake nothing of this character. They are grand, impressive, and truthfully dramatic, if you will; but they have not the remotest reference to the metaphysical or the divine.

Beautiful also is the ‘“ Lachrymosa,” the effect of the plaintive notes of the mezzo-soprano against the bass solo, giving a depth of expression to the words almost in..describable, These two movements are perhaps amongst the purest specimens of spontaneous writing in the work; but we must also instance the “ Recordare,” the bass-solo “Confutatis” (although we can scarcely reconcile ourselves to the sequence of fifths which accompanies it), and the final “ Libera me;”” but in naming these we need scarcely say that they comprise only a small portion of the many charming pieces in a composition which cannot fail to take a permanent place amongst the accepted works of modern composers. The solo parts were admirably sustained by Madame Stolz, Madame Waldmann, ‘Signor Masini, and Signor Medini, the first named lady displaying a clear and liquid soprano voice, eminently suited to give the utmost effect to Signor Verdi’s music. Madame Wald‘mann was also in every respect highly satisfactory, and both tenor and bass acquitted themselves of their arduous task most successfully, Signor Masini, however, occasionally indulging in a tremolo which much detracted from the effect of his really beautiful voice. The choruses were finely sung by the Royal Albert Hall Choir (which had been previously well drilled by Mr. Barnby), and the orchestra was everything that could be desired. Signor Verdi, who conducted, received quite an ovation, and was evidently much pleased with the manner in which his music had been prepared. In consequence of the great success of the work, two special representations, at popular prices, were given on the 22nd and 2oth ult. (both under the conductorship of the composer), before large audiences.', 'But there were the immortal operas of Mozart, which came forth like stars in their courses to dazzle the musical world, and to cast into shade all that had gone before them. | These wonderful productions gave quite a new turn to ‘the current of public feeling: all that had been previously written became ‘insipid at once, and the glory of the Italian School was completely eclipsed by that of Germany. Soon after, Rossini arose, and in the delight and rapture with which he was hailed there is nothing surprising. In him was found a gentleman who could be equally long, equally loud, and equally astounding with any German to be named—-one who if he had not so much fire as Mozart, had more smoke, and whose operas, from their novelty, for novel they. certainly were to the Italians, must have ‘seemed calculated to restore to them the rank which they had lost. In the second place, no one ever wrote so little for his art and so much for the singer as Rossini; this I take to be the great secret of his success.

However this might be, Rossini received new proofs of admiration from the superintendent of the royal theatres, who, in order -to prevail on him to remain at Naples, constituted him director of the theatres S. Carlo and del Fondo; but Rossini shewed at Naples the same indifference he has since displayed at the Theatre Italien in Paris. In 1817 he gave his Armida, which did not fulfil the expectations of the public; this opera was written in the style of Jomelli, whose “score was probably under his eyes, consequently its success was of a very short duration. But his reputation, already warmly disputed by his adversaries, suffered nothing. In the following year he made a little excursion to Rome, to bring out his Adelaide di Borgogna at the Argentina ; on his return to Naples he wrote his Mosé, which obtained an immense success ; for, independently of the very considerable receipts which it produced, no other ‘music was sung throughout Italy. Enthusiasm was never before excited to such a point. The praises of his genius, and the incomparable work full of life and originality which had just crowned his labours, resounded from all parts. ‘Towards the end of the same year, 1818, a farce called Adina, intended for the theatre St. Charles of Lisbon, paid well, and preceded Ricciardo and Zoraide, which had also immense success, and filled all the connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs with a general delirium. It was then that the famous epistle of Cimarosa appeared, dated from the Elysian fields, which elevated Rossini’s music to the skies, and ranked. him amongst the greatest geniuses that Italy could boast. The interpreter of love, Paisiello, the tender and impassioned Piccini, exclaimed with delight on seeing this work, and applauded it before the Gods. There is a discussion between Durante and Jomelli on two acts of this opera. Some reproaches are addressed to him relative to his melodies, as well as different observations, which interest us no more than they did Rossini himself. In 1819. Ermione was written for St. Carlo in the same style ; but this opera produced but little effect. Soon after he set off for Venice, where his Kdoardo e Cristina was brought out.

Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.', 'About the year 1653, having the reputation of being an admirable composer, he, ‘at the request of great personages,’ says Anthony Wood, ‘composed several sets of ayres of four parts, to be performed by violins and an organ, which being esteemed the best of their kind that could be then composed, were sent as great rarities into Germany, to the . court of Archduke Leopold (afterwards Emperor), and often played by his (the prince’s) own musicians, he himself being a composer, and great admirer of music.’ And here we may remark, en passant, that, less than two cen_turies ago, English music was held in high estimation ia Germany, and there sought after by the cognoscenti: now hardly a page of it is to be met with in the whole of that great, that very musical country, a country on which we depend for almost every work of excellence produced at our concerts, or listened to in our drawing-rooms. It seems to us that it would be no difficult matter to assign satisfactory reasons for this; but to enter into the subject here would be departing from our main purposes, which are chiefly biographical, and, to a certain extent, critical. In 1658, Mr. Rogers was, by a mandate from the pro_ tector Cromwell, admitted to the degree of bachelor in music by the university of Cambridge. At the restoration, the city of London having invited Charles II., and both houses of parliament, to dine at Guildhall, Rogers was employed to write some music for the occasion, which, Wood tells us, ‘being admirably well done, gave great content, and the author being present, obtained a great name for his composition, and a plentiful reward.’ This consisted of a hymn, beginning ‘ Exultate justi in Domino,’ of which ‘those stanzas daily sung by way of grace after meat at Magdalen College, Oxford, are part,’ as we learn from Sir John Hawkins ; but of the rest, we are not enabled to give any account. He soon after became organist of Eton, and afterwards of Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1669, the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of doctor in music, an honour which did not secure him against a change in fortune, for he died in very straitened circumstances in 1698.', 'About the year 1653, having the reputation of being an admirable composer, he, ‘at the request of great personages,’ says Anthony Wood, ‘composed several sets of ayres of four parts, to be performed by violins and an organ, which being esteemed the best of their kind that could be then composed, were sent as great rarities into Germany, to the . court of Archduke Leopold (afterwards Emperor), and often played by his (the prince’s) own musicians, he himself being a composer, and great admirer of music.’ And here we may remark, en passant, that, less than two cen_turies ago, English music was held in high estimation ia Germany, and there sought after by the cognoscenti: now hardly a page of it is to be met with in the whole of that great, that very musical country, a country on which we depend for almost every work of excellence produced at our concerts, or listened to in our drawing-rooms.

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'HERR WILHELM)’s performance of the first Allegro and Andante of Rubinstein’s Violin Concerto in G, at the third concert, was in every respect admirable. The composition, too, is highly interesting, the Allegro, especially, being a finely written movement and containing some most effective conversational passages between the solo instrument and the orchestra. The principal orchestral piece—Schumann’s Symphony in B flat, No. 4—was a welcome item in the rogramme, and was on the whole extremely well played.', ""The greater part of the ‘“‘ Gloria’? must be pronounced by no means worthy of Schubert’s reputation. It is effective and brilliant music, full of tune, as is everything from its composer's pen; but the first movement might almost be called absolutely commonplace. The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended.

We have reason to believe the recitative to be the production of Madame C. herself, and the air has so long been publishéd with Pucitta’s name, that we entertain little doubt of its being his. The preface to the oratorio of the Messiah is a succinct account of the invention and progress of this species of composition, written in asimilar manner to that of the concerts. In the course of his narrative, Mr. Crosse has thrown new light on the assertion of Sir. J. Hawkins, “that the Messiah was first performed in 1741, and coldly received.” Mr. C. gives reasons which render it probable that it was not brought out till 1742, and that it was from the first highly estimated. Sir J. Hawkins however was a man of such determined accuracy, that he rarely if ever hazarded a fact but on good grounds. Wecanstateso much on the most certain authority. Upon tlie accompaniments of Mozart to the Messiah, Mr. Crosse has introduced some able and sound observations, and in: an admirable temper. Mr. Crosse also distinguishes Mr. Vaughan’s singing “‘ Thy rebuke,” and the succeeding air, with particular encomium. We have no hesitation not only in en- forcing the learned author’s-remark, but we fearlessly pronounce that his delivery of the former is the purest and most elevated example of impassioned recitative now to be heard.
