What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'T transcribe these pretty words, because it is remarkable that they were written to the music, which was a minuet already published by Rameau amongst his harpsichord music. This air is charming, and perfectly in place: it has but one faultnamely, that of being much too high for the voice of the singer for whom it was written ; at the same time, it would be too low if it were transposed. We see that a hundred years since, as in our own times, (but, perhaps, rather less frequently) poets were cbliged to submit the rhythm of their words to the will of the musician, \x0c It would be troublesome to our readers to continue an examination of operas which are perfectly unknown to them. It will be sufficient to give a list of the dramatic works of Rameau; he bronght out successfully, Les Talens Lyriques, 1739; Dardanus,1739 ; Les Fétes de Polymnie,1745 ; LaPrincesse de Navarre, 1745; Le Temple de la Gloire, 1745; Les Fétes de VHymen, et del Amour, 1747 ; Zais, 1748 ; Pygmalion, 1748 ; [lais,1749 ; Plateé, 1749 ; Zeroastre, 1749 ; Acanthe et Céphise, 1751; La Guirlande\\751 ; Daphnis et Eglé,\\753; Lysis et Délié, 1753; La Natesanec d’ Osiris, 1754; Anacréon, 1754; Zephire, 1754; Néleé et Mirthis, 1754; lo, 1754; Le retour d’Astreé, 1757; Les surprises, de ? Amour, 1759; Les Sybarites, 1759 ; and Les Paladins,1760. Although most of these pieces are in one act, and of trifling importance, the number must seem prodigious, when we consider that Rameau did not commence his dramatic career until he was 50 years old. Hewas 77 when he composed his last opera, and at his death, which took place four years after, in 1764, three manuscript scores were found ready for representation. Rameau’s scores have only been engraved with a pianoforte arrangement, including some particular orchestral effects here and there.', 'Hippolyte “et Arcie (such was the title of Rameau’s first work) was brought out on the Ist of October, 1783.

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose? Nevertheless, whatever be the exercise proposed, | am_ bold enough to offer myself as a candidate, and doubt not that I shall have a good chance of being blackballed as well as Mr. Flowers, the would be founder of the society.

The organist’s intention was apparent, and it was supposed this folly could not last long ; but a month passed, and still this frightful uproar continued. At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.', 'His success among the canons was insufficient for him—the public of Auvergne became odious to him. Paris, with its promise of glory, again gilded the ambitious dreams of Rameau; he could no longer live within these narrow limits ; his engagement restrained him; buthe hoped the bishop would consent to give him his liberty. The chapter of Clermont felt too happy in having such an organist, to get rid of him voluntarily. His request was refused ; and the good canons, thinking to ameliorate their decisions, told him that the high price they attached to his talent was the motive which prevented them from complying with his demand. He found that the only means he had of regaining his liberty was to lose the talent for which they kept him a captive.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

While citing Beethoven, indeed, a contemporary might have adduced Béethoven’s own words in the famous letter about the Secend Mass—the fact of which having called forth no acknowledement from Cherubini was inexplicable, until accounted for by the other fact of its never having reached Cherubini’s hands. For though, as Mendelssohn tells us, the composer of Afedea said of Beethoven's later music: “Ca me fait éternucr,”’ he entertained'a genuine respect for the earlier and middle productions of that magnificent genius. The rest were perhaps not exactly in his sphere. But apart from Beethoven and other distinguished Germans, there are those at home, on whose opinions sufficient reliance might have, been placed, to justify long since a trial of one of tha,one-° ras of Cherubini, either in Italian or English. he time is come at last, however, and the result surpasses what could, under any ordinary circumstances, have been expected.

His fugues are indeed ‘superior to those of Spohr, Schneider, Loewe yes, even Beethoven’s-—in. their oratorios ; but they cannot be ranked near Bach’s,, Handels, Lotti’s, and those of otfier old counterThat sublime and powerful theme, ‘‘Rise up, arise!” in the oratorio ‘St. Paul,” loses all. its beauty and clearness in the midst of the fugue through its harmonicand modulating overbur‘ dening. Fugues are deprived of their. beauty by this kind of modulation.

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose? Nevertheless, whatever be the exercise proposed, | am_ bold enough to offer myself as a candidate, and doubt not that I shall have a good chance of being blackballed as well as Mr. Flowers, the would be founder of the society.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA. Tue production of Auber’s sparkling Opera “Les Diamans de la Couronne,” with Madame Patti in the part of Caterina, was naturally looked forward to as the great event of the season; but the version of this composition submitted to the audience of the Royal Italian Opera on the 8rd ult, could have satisfied none but the vocalists and the conductor. In the first place the work suffers from the heavy recitatives, composed according to the “ serious” Italian Opera model, by Signor Vianesi; but this we could forgiye were Auber’s music left untouched. So far from this being the case, however, in addition to ruthlessly cutting out portions of the original, pieces are taken from the composer’s early Operas, “Ta Neige,” and “Leicester,” and introduced without, as we can perceive, the slightest reason ; then a duet and some songs written especially for the occasion by Signor Vianesi, are dragged in with as much coolness as if the Italian Opera stage were merely intended as a platform for the display of the caprices of singers; and, perhaps worst of all, the music of Sebastiano, composed by Auber for a tenor, has been mutilated and altered to please the baritone, Signor Cotogni.', 'In our last volume* we gave a sketch of the music at the Winter Theatres, which exhausted nearly all the novelty produced during the year. Just before the close of Covent Garden “‘ Carron side,” an opera by Signor Liverati, was produced with success. It was chiefly written in imitation of Scotch Melody, and the airs were generally pleasing. One trio, in which the Italian taste of the composer manifested itself, had great merit, At Drury-lane, Artaxerxes was revived, Madame Fearon taking the part of Mandane, and Shakespeare’s T. aming of the Shrew was given with much music, for the purpose of introducing Miss Ayton as Catharine. She sustained the character in a manner to add much‘to her reputation for ability asan actress. ‘Thus things have proceeded much in the old train; but it is singular, that while upon every occasion when the appearance of a new singer or any other cause compels a recurrence. to legitimate opera, Artaxerxes is resuscitated—it is singular that no further attempt should be made to try the taste of that public, which for more than half a century has run after this the single specimen of ‘the lyric drama we possess, by a sound and regular composition of the same species.

For ten years Jarnowick was in great favour with the public. The charactéristics of his style were purity, precision, and elegance, but he failed in producing a vigorous tone, in sensibility of expression, und above all, in his cadences. Being obliged to quit France, Jarnowick was succeeded by Viotti, whose superior talents soon completely eclipsed those of his predecessor.

He remained in this place till the year 1778, and then proceeded on his travels ; and after residing for some time at Berlin, directed his course towards Paris, where he displayed his talents in the Concert Spirituel. At this period, Jarnowick was the great object of public attention, and excited universal admiration by his concertos, which were full of beauty: but Viotti soon eclipsed bis fame, as well by the elegance and grandeur of his compositions, as by the noble and powerful manner in which he executed them.

By the way, I have been told that she is not really blind, and that the bandage over her eyes was placed there by the “old ones,” only because ‘they found themselves unable to account rationally for so many of her whims and caprices.. But for my part, 1 cannot believe this, especially when I consider the extraordinary eminence to which she has raised some men, in spite of their shallow qualifications. Here, Sir, without going into general history, I might produce numerous examples of forgotten. poets and painters, whom Fortune, with her help-mates Fashion and Folly, made the idols of their day. But I have too much sense of propriety to shew my reading by trespassing so much on your valuable space, and therefore I shall content myself with glancing at the musicians; indeed it will be sufficient for my purpose if I select him whose name stands at the head of this letter. How common it is to hear Rossini called “ the child of Fore tune”—the spoiled child, according to some—“ the most lucky fellow” that ever put pen to music paper, and other epithets which shew the sensation produced by his brilliant and extraordinary career. Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt. It is no wonder, then, that his music is without just expression—that i is, without that \x0c 8 ROSSINI: agreement between the sound and the : sense which all cultiv ated.', 'For the Cambridge meeting the names of Mesd.

His fugues are indeed ‘superior to those of Spohr, Schneider, Loewe yes, even Beethoven’s-—in. their oratorios ; but they cannot be ranked near Bach’s,, Handels, Lotti’s, and those of otfier old counterThat sublime and powerful theme, ‘‘Rise up, arise!” in the oratorio ‘St. Paul,” loses all. its beauty and clearness in the midst of the fugue through its harmonicand modulating overbur‘ dening. Fugues are deprived of their. beauty by this kind of modulation. If we make use of this ancient form, we must do it| in such pureness as did the great Italian and German masters. , 7 Weaker yet than ‘‘Rise up, arise !” are the final fugiies of the first and second part of the same oratorio; but the solos, chorals and free choruses elevate ‘‘St. Paul” above all works of this genre ever written: by his contemporaries. ; I prefer Mendelssohn’s harmonizing even to that of Sebastian Bach, who, in this respect, as well as.in the entire counterpoint art, is con‘sidered the greatest master. There are too many passing-notes. in the harmonizations of Bach; Mendelssohn’s, however, always show exquisite taste. Some esteem his oratorio ‘*Elijah” higher than that of ‘‘St. Paul.” As a later production ‘‘Elijah” is indeed more powerful in its entire formation ; but it is not so fresh, and for this reason ‘St. Paul’ will always be more cherished by suchas prefer vigor and spirit to knowledge and science.""]",Pepusch,Q371825,person,Q7166542,Q7166542,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre.

It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau.

Rameau was then fifty years old.', 'At the next service, instead of the beautiful harmonies to which they were uccustomed, nothing was heard but a confusion of indistinct sounds, in fact, an assemblage of the most discordant notes, and a melange of squeaking and msupportable noises. The organist’s intention was apparent, and it was supposed this folly could not last long ; but a month passed, and still this frightful uproar continued. At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""]",Keeton,Q1438256,person,,,0,0,0,0,QID,1,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually.

Bishop

None

It has been a generally received opinion, that, however deeply his loss was deplored by our poet, the death of Gravina was a great benefit to his future fame, for it is supposed that, had he lived, his advice would have cramped his pupil's ideas, disposed to all the pathos and beauty of passion and nature, with the rules and imitations of the Greek drama. Certain it is, however, that Metastasio mourned over his patron as a son; nor was his gratitude at all diminished, when by Gravina’s will, signed in 1718, he found himself sole master of all his property, consisting of 15,000 crowns, a superb library, and a small estate in the kingdoin of Naples. The generosity of our poet’s disposition, however, soon ran through this possession; and two years after Gravina’s death, all that re' mained to him was an inconsiderable landed estate. Finding it, therefote, necessary to court some other genius than the Muse, he placed himself under the care of Paglietti, a man described as made up wholly of law, a bitter enemy to poetry, one who hated the sound of rhyme, and the very sight of a poet, and who was mercilessly, intolerant of the slightest deviation from worldly prudence.

H. Franz, entitled ‘““ Der WArwolf,” ithe words by Paul Frohberg) is looked upon as an event of considerable importance in those musical circles of the northern capital where the reformatory ideas of Richard Wagner are favourably received, The work in question had to be produced under the same disadvantages against which the operatic music of the composer of ‘‘ Lohengrin”? had, until very recently, to contend in this country; the performance took place in the concert-room, and, by being thus divested of the dramatic action and stage surroundings, those elements were wanting which ought to be inseparably connected with the music of the modern “ art-work.”’ Such at least is the theory of its founder, and, as applied to his own opera-dramas, it is undoubtedly true. Looking however, at the subject of Franz’s Opera and the dramatic action it indicates, we begin to doubt whether the absence of the latter, as in the present case, would not, in some parts at least, be rather an advantage to the music than otherwise. The following is the plot (we are quoting the International Gazette of April the 24th) :—* ‘Der Warwolf’ is laid in the time of the thirty years’ war. The beast itself had the misfortune of being a wolf by night, and a man by day instead of a wolf all the time; and he is also endowed with certain magical powers. One of these was represented by a magic ring, which comes into possession of Merode a trooper under Tilly. Merode precipice. ; and achorus.” We fear it will be some time before stagemanagers will venture upon the representation of this gains possession of the lovely Oda, the daughter of Count Busso, a magnate of the Harz region, while Oda is loved by and loves Eginhard, a. neighbouring Count.', 'The excessive tenderness of the melodies which colour the love scenes between Elsa and Lohengrin, the chivalric character of the music accompanying the stage pageantry, the tumultuous and exciting nature of the choruses of the people, and the masterly power displayed in the instrumentation must be felt by all who have ears to hear, and judgment to return a verdict according to the evidence before them. Something indeed there is much deeper than this—something which no man better than Wagner knows must make its way.; but the process will be slowat least in England—for art must cease to be fashionable before its real value can be gauged, and Opera in this country has not yet become National. The truth cannot be disguised that the Teutonic element in the house had a marvellous effect in teaching the audience that “‘ Lohengrin ” was not to be judged by the ordinary standard; so when the usual round of applause was given for the favourite singers on their entrance and the boisterous marks of approbation burst forth after an effective morceau, a very decided “‘ hush ” convinced the astonished Opera habitués that the vocalists must be considered as secondary to the work they were interpreting, and that any congratulations to individual performers must be reserved for the fall of the curtain. Thus far then has Wagner influenced us for good; and whatever may be the ultimate fate of his works in England, there can be little doubt of the truth of his conviction that the composer has a higher mission than that of administering to the frivolous taste of a frivolous audience. “Lohengrin? must not be accepted as the latest emThere may beand probably is—as much difference between ‘‘ Lohengrin ” and the ‘“* Ring des Niebeliingen ” (which has not yet been heard), as there is between ‘Der Fliegende Hollander ” and Lohengrin.” Wagner’s books must be consulted by all who wish to trace the growth of the idea which has ruled his artistic life; but the result of his philosophy may be found in his Operas, and so progressively developed as to convince even those who disagree with him of the singleness of purpose with which he has worked. Some feeling of disappointment may be widely felt when we are told that the “‘ art work of the future’ is to be based upon mythical legends, and that consequently ‘ Lohengrin” ‘*the type of the sole, real classical subject,” and Elsa, ‘‘woman—woman, as not previously understood,” should be characters which never could have had any real existence; but those who would judge Wagner are bound to come into court with an unbiassed mind; and when we say that for five and twenty years the Opera now submitted to our notice has been gradually rising in public estimation; that it has been played to enthusiastic audiences not only in Germany, but at Bologna, Florence and in the United States, there can be little doubt that it contains within it an element of vitality which cannot fail to preserve it even in the most uncongenial atmosphere.']",Wagner,Q1511,person,Q2539239,Q2539239,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

He seems to have set himself the task of compensating us for our sufferings.” With this quick and generous nature was still joined the modesty of the boy :—‘ How delightful it is,” wrote Moscheles, ‘when he brings some of his new compositions, and, after playing them, waits with child-like modesty for an expression of my opinion. Any other would long since have become aware that in him I recognize my own master, and that Iam in raptures where he ts expecting to be sharply criticised. Do what I will to give him a correct view and appreciation of our relative positions, he always insists upon subordinating himself to me as his master.” This is charming as regards Mendelssohn ; hardly so as regards Moscheles, who, in his enthusiasm, did all that was possible to ruin the modesty he admired.

It was Mendelssohn’s birthday, and his friends combined to keep it with due festivity. Moscheles must describe the revels :—‘‘ The proceedings were opened wifh a capital comic scene between two ladies’ maids, acted, in the Frankfort dialect, by Cécile (Madame Mendelssohn) andher sister.

Butit really is not so easy as may be supposed to assign the absolute degree of merit songs of this kind possess. Happy combinations of melody are become so infinitely numerous, and the structure of these compositions are so much better understood, that there is a certain tincture of elegance in almost every thing that is published. It seems that the capital distinction between that which is merely agreeable and that which affects, now lies in the art of giving the music an imaginative, a poetical character as it were. ‘These three songs are all of this kind. ae Mr. Cianchettini’ s English | is not so graceful.as his Italian canzonet. But he very seldom writes vocal music that is not superior. These are trifles, but they are elegant trifles, and composed with much feeling. In the latter especially there are some passages of sweet melody. We object however altogether to the frequent interspersion of ornaments in the English song, and more especially to the places in which they are introduced. Ornaments ought always to mean something—but why are such particles as and and to to be thus illustrated ?, We know Mr. Cianchettini will reply, it is the musical position and not the word that requires a grace... But we could shew, were it worth while, that this is an insufficient, though it be some extenuation. There are not less than six volate upon the last. of these insignificant monosyllables.', 'Each number is laid out after the model of the first movement of a sonata—the only difference being the omission of the répeat of the first part. Another noteworthy feature of the music is the great skill with which the composer has added voice parts to what was already complete. _Excepting that the accompaniment is in places fuller and richer than is customary with Haydn, it would be difficult ‘for anyone who only knew the work in its present form to suspect that the chorus was altogether an afterthought.', 'Haydn’s biographers state of him that he always conceived a story before he wrote a Symphony, such as of a sea voyage with the vicissitudes of prosperity and tempest, of a course of true love which never yet ran smooth, or of a departure to battle and a victorious return, and that the music is the language wherein these unacknowledged tales are told. Haydn is not the single instance of a composer who has passed through such a mental process. It signifies nothing to the argument whether the artist be the inventor or only the illustrator of his theme; Shakspeare’s Tempest may be before his mind’s eye when he paints his fanciful. tone-portrait, or a conceit of a storm at sea with its results that never had action outside his own thoughts, or the loss of the Medusa, or any other veritable shipwreck ; and he may amuse himself, if no one else, by making his music wild or tranquil, agitated or serene, according as bad or good weather prevails in his imagination, and as the fears or hopes are paramount of the voyagers. This is not all; without admitting, even to himself, a plot, he is yet a narrator, if only of the thoughts and feelings that live and work within him during his period of composition.

These important persons, who have received from nature herself letters patent, whereby they become authorized to controul -and dictate—these important persons have a laudable anxiety to be the principal objects of attraction whenever they appear, and it would be cruel to censure them for consulting their own gratification rather than the good ofart.

This would not have happened had Rossini possessed the power of managing and varying his subjects, which severe study alone can give; and it is the more to be regretted, because he has, from nature, feelings for dramatic composition which might have advanced him to the first'rank of writers."", 'But there were the immortal operas of Mozart, which came forth like stars in their courses to dazzle the musical world, and to cast into shade all that had gone before them. | These wonderful productions gave quite a new turn to ‘the current of public feeling: all that had been previously written became ‘insipid at once, and the glory of the Italian School was completely eclipsed by that of Germany. Soon after, Rossini arose, and in the delight and rapture with which he was hailed there is nothing surprising. In him was found a gentleman who could be equally long, equally loud, and equally astounding with any German to be named—-one who if he had not so much fire as Mozart, had more smoke, and whose operas, from their novelty, for novel they. certainly were to the Italians, must have ‘seemed calculated to restore to them the rank which they had lost. In the second place, no one ever wrote so little for his art and so much for the singer as Rossini; this I take to be the great secret of his success.

Urb. Cathedralis Musice prefecto in lucem edite.” Philippo Nicoletti, who flourished at the sane time with the last-mentioned composer, published several madrigals, which were much admired by his ceuntrymen; also a great deal of church music, and he became chapel-master to one of the cathedrals of Rome.. | The next composer who claims our attention was one w ho con‘tributed greatly towards the. improvement of madrigals, a species of composition at that time much wanting the hand ofa skilful musician to carry it to perfection. Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.']",Crescentini,Q552124,person,Q37059167,Q37059167,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose? Nevertheless, whatever be the exercise proposed, | am_ bold enough to offer myself as a candidate, and doubt not that I shall have a good chance of being blackballed as well as Mr. Flowers, the would be founder of the society.

As may be expected, the performance of the bénéficiare was one of the principal attractions of the pro-_ gramme, although when we state that he was aided in the instrumental department by his talented pupil Miss Kate Steel (of the Royal Academy of Music) at the pianoforte, Mr. Lazarus (clarionet), and Messrs. Sainton, Amor, Burnett, Pettitt, and White (violins, viola, violoncello, and contra-basso); that Miss Jessie Jones and Mr. Cummings were the solo vocalists, and that a selection of part-music was given by a group of female students of the Royal Academy of Music, it will be seen that, with the modesty of a true artist, Mr. Macfarren did not place himself in undue _prominence before his supporters. Asa composer he was “well represented on the occasion. His “ Suite de Piéces,” already most favourably mentioned in our reviewing columns, and the Second Sonata for pianoforte and violin, which we hope shortly to notice at length, were exceedingly well rendered and warmly applauded, the valuable services of M. Sainton being secured for the latter work. The programme also included Mozart’s Trio in E flat, for piano‘forte, clarionet, and viola, Mendelssohn’s pianoforte Duet “*¢ Allegro Brillante” (Op. 92), in which Miss Kate Steel ably assisted her master, and Sterndale Bennett’s Sestet in F sharp minor, which with the concert giver at the pianoforte, and the stringed instruments in the hands of the artists already named, it is needless to say, went to perfection. Signor Randegger accompanied the vocal music with his accustomed care and intelligence.', 'The pieces are a quartet and chorus from Haydn, a base solo and quartet from Himmel, a trio from Cherubini, a duet for tenor _..and base from a MS. of Naumann, a quartet from the Benedictus of Huminel’s first mass, a quartet and chorus of Andreas Romberg, a quartet, from a rare MS. of Bonelli, and a Tantum ergo and chorus by Mr: Novello. The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand.

In the present work, more than in any other of these anthems, the composer used old material. The subject of the opening symphony is borrowed from the Ode for Queen Anne's Birthday, and the movement in the form in which we find it here is identical with the first movement of the third oboe concerto. The. commencement of the first chorus is taken from the Passion of Christ, and the phrase, ‘‘The heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works,” is nothing more than “the heavens and all the powers therein,” of the Utrecht “Te Deum.” The subject of the last chorus is also taken from the same work. The finest part of this anthem is the choral writing. The second chorus, “ Righteousness and equity,” is the best number, and seems to have furnished the composer with some suggestions for the chorus, ‘‘ Thou hast prevented him,” in the Coronation anthem, “ The king shall rejoice.” Excepting the trio, “‘Thou rulest the raging of the sea,” the solo pieces are not in Handel's best manner; and, on the whole, this will hardly be considered one of the finest anthems of the series.""]",Wales,Q20875,person,,,0,0,0,0,QID,1,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

The number before us contains a new work. of Mozart, from a score in the possession of Mr. Latrobe, whose selections may be said to have first opened that species of knowledge which Mr. Novello is perfecting. To that.gentleman. indeed vast obligations are owing not only for the solicitude with which he has sought out. and preserved the manuscript works of the finest writers for the Roman Church, but for the liberality. with which he assists in giving them ‘tothe public. Mozart’s “ Litania de venerabile sacramentum” constitutes this first. number, and a magnificent work it is. The very first page exhibits a proof of the author’s feeling of effects, “It commences with a short symphony for the instruments—an allegro molto—which when the voices come in with the awful words. “ Kyrie eleison,” changes to adagio i in a manner to make the blood curdle. Here however the return to the rapid time of the opening offends our sense of expression, but the charge must be general, for we must be content to allow much to vehement notions of the musical language of passion, if we would relish (what we can never reconcile) the mass music even of those writers who are received as the most sublime in this species.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain.

The proper course for the chjectors would have been to prove that Spohr has either generally treated his subject with a levity unbecoming its sacred character, or has, in certain and distinct portions of it, violated dramatic truth—(which phrase we use in a far more extended than its theatrical sense )—neither of which demonstrations has been attempted. But, as we believe the word oratorio—” the meaning of which term we imagine ut extremely difficult to limit—misleads many people with vague and uncertain notions of musical character, we think the matter worth a brief discus:ion.” In the first place, whenever sacred music, or an oratorio, is mentioned, we are apt at once mentaliy to refer to the music of Handel as the standar!, and to insist that ail other composers sha‘l write sacred music in his style. his occurs, partly because the ponderous and magnificent stvie of Handel is, without question, more capable than any other of awakening ideas of the subliine, and partly because we have, for more than a century, been accustomed to its association with them. But we must not neglect to remark that this peculiar fitness to sacred purposes which we recognise in the music of Handei arose more frum natural necessity than from any desire on his part to travel out of his usual path for the peculiar iliustration of a peculiar text.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", ""Mr. Cullum’s performance, (pianoforte) with Mr. Blagrove (violin) in Herz and De Beriot’s duet concertante La Fianeée, drew down showers of applause.

Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp.

London. J.', ""Tus very interesting little work. is, to the best of our belief, new alike in idea and execution. Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure.

A century has scarcely elapsed and for more than sixty years the theories of Rameau have been abandoned; his system is only known to a few of the erudite, and his music to no one! <A strange vicissitude to which the votaries of the art we cultivate are liable. Poetry may be said to be eternal ; it addresses itself to a comprehension which varies but little, in spite of the infinence of time and circumstance ; painting and sculpture have a fixed basis: they are an imitation of nature, whose models do not change; the men of the time of Apelles and Praziteles were the.', 'Notwithstanding these faults which belong in a The revolution which Gluck In spite of his sojourn in Italy, Rameau knew I know few studies more interesting than that of A collection of harpsichord pieces, by Rameau, which are taken from his operas, the others appear would not prove uninteresting, if it were only to show the state of music at that time.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

It is effective and brilliant music, full of tune, as is everything from its composer's pen; but the first movement might almost be called absolutely commonplace. The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

An organisation which, in moments: leisure, rose to half hysterical excitement, or sunk: profound depression, could not long endure the wear and tear of life. e events casting their shadows before. In 1829, as everybody knows, Mendelssohn first visited this country, bringing with him his Overture to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” his String Quartet in A', 'About the year 1653, having the reputation of being an admirable composer, he, ‘at the request of great personages,’ says Anthony Wood, ‘composed several sets of ayres of four parts, to be performed by violins and an organ, which being esteemed the best of their kind that could be then composed, were sent as great rarities into Germany, to the . court of Archduke Leopold (afterwards Emperor), and often played by his (the prince’s) own musicians, he himself being a composer, and great admirer of music.’ And here we may remark, en passant, that, less than two cen_turies ago, English music was held in high estimation ia Germany, and there sought after by the cognoscenti: now hardly a page of it is to be met with in the whole of that great, that very musical country, a country on which we depend for almost every work of excellence produced at our concerts, or listened to in our drawing-rooms. It seems to us that it would be no difficult matter to assign satisfactory reasons for this; but to enter into the subject here would be departing from our main purposes, which are chiefly biographical, and, to a certain extent, critical. In 1658, Mr. Rogers was, by a mandate from the pro_ tector Cromwell, admitted to the degree of bachelor in music by the university of Cambridge. At the restoration, the city of London having invited Charles II., and both houses of parliament, to dine at Guildhall, Rogers was employed to write some music for the occasion, which, Wood tells us, ‘being admirably well done, gave great content, and the author being present, obtained a great name for his composition, and a plentiful reward.’ This consisted of a hymn, beginning ‘ Exultate justi in Domino,’ of which ‘those stanzas daily sung by way of grace after meat at Magdalen College, Oxford, are part,’ as we learn from Sir John Hawkins ; but of the rest, we are not enabled to give any account. He soon after became organist of Eton, and afterwards of Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1669, the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of doctor in music, an honour which did not secure him against a change in fortune, for he died in very straitened circumstances in 1698.']",Mendelssohn,Q46096,person,Q41783627;Q47513887,Q41783627,0,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Haydn is not the single instance of a composer who has passed through such a mental process. It signifies nothing to the argument whether the artist be the inventor or only the illustrator of his theme; Shakspeare’s Tempest may be before his mind’s eye when he paints his fanciful. tone-portrait, or a conceit of a storm at sea with its results that never had action outside his own thoughts, or the loss of the Medusa, or any other veritable shipwreck ; and he may amuse himself, if no one else, by making his music wild or tranquil, agitated or serene, according as bad or good weather prevails in his imagination, and as the fears or hopes are paramount of the voyagers. This is not all; without admitting, even to himself, a plot, he is yet a narrator, if only of the thoughts and feelings that live and work within him during his period of composition. The same man will produce a graver work or a gayer, a calmer or a more agitated, a month sooner or later in his life, according to the passions that sway his heart, and be unconscious all the while that he is setting down an autobiography. It is hard to believe, indeed, that any artistic work can be all expressionless, save only a scholastic exercise; nay, perhaps not even this, for the man’s patience or his want of it, his resignation or his eagerness will speak out in the smoothness or roughness of his lines, in the formality or quaintness of his words, in the fluency or angularity of his counterpoint.', ""Tus very interesting little work. is, to the best of our belief, new alike in idea and execution. Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'His directions are succinct and perspicuous, his examples are good, and his book will be found eminently useful.

Moreover, her superiority over every one else is noé so evident to us as to induce us to put up with, much less admire, her assumption, and we will not endure it while we have liberty to make our opinions public. Her abrupt exit from the orchestra, in the middle of the third part, (a breach of decorum which our late lamented Editor, forced out of his ordinary equanimity of temper, had occasion to stigmatize with such severity, last season, at Exeter Hall) is thus judiciously reprehended by a Manchester journal :— “ The exquisite passages, ‘Since by man came death,’ and ‘For as in Adam all die,’ were spoilt in their effect by the questionable taste that induced Miss Novello to hasten out of the orchestra imme* diately on the delivery of the latter passage. As this lady is at the very head of her professsion, it is more necessary that she should be very guarded in all that takes place before her inferiors, as imitators are more readily found copying what is wrong, and therefore easy, than striving after what is great, and only to be acquired by labour and intense application. Braham gives an impressive example to all young aspirants after fame in his conduct in the orchestra. Grave, calm, and attentive, he never lets the audience feel that his whole soul is not engaged. Even the manner in which he waits for the conclusion of the symphony, ere he lays aside his music, or acknowledges the plaudits of his audience, is worthy of imitation, inasmuch as it completes the illusion which his voice has created.” And surely what Mr. Braham dares not do, is beyond the province of Miss Clara Novello.', 'The introduction of Mr. ‘Braham at these concerts, for the first.', 'King (The) commands the attendance of Mr. Braham, 94; postpones a party to avoid injury to his benefit, ibid.']",Braham,Q5231664,person,Q16860333,Q16860333,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Mendelssohn had returned from Switzerland, and his friend wrote :—‘‘In mind dear Felix is the same as ever, but physically he seems altered; he is aged, weakened, and his walk is less elastic than before.” This was the beginning of the end, and soon we read of his seizure at Frau Frege’s house, his partial recovery, the final blow, and the sad spectacle presented as the master lay unconscious on his death-bed, surrounded by loving and despairing friends.

In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7.""]",Burns,Q81960,person,Q1408775,Q1408775,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking.

We shall relate one of Garrick in confirmation, which was told to the writer of this article by the friend who was with him at the time. Garrick walking with this gentleman through the streets of London, met a butcher’s boy carrying some meat in a tray on his head, and .. whistling as he went for want of thought.’ Garrick sprung upon him, seized him by the collar, and with the most vehement gesticulations exclaimed, “ You villain, have I not told you a thousand times not to do that?” Theboy’s features underwent an immediate change to consternation, and he-stammered out “ Indeed Sir I never saw you before.’ Garrick quitted his hold, said he was mistaken, and passed on. His friend scarcely less astonished than the poor boy, asked what this could possibly mean. ‘¢ Why,” said Garrick, ‘¢ I wished to see the effect of surprize and terror upon simple nature, and I"", '“6 J E céde A Ja tentation d’essayer un portrait musicale de Mademoiselle Pasta.

When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses.

It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau.

That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir.

From beginning to end it displays a masterly talent, which nothing can weary or exhaust.” Théatre Italien.—It might naturally have been expected ‘that the revival of the lively Italiana in Algeri, with the first appearance of Signora Pisaroni in that character, would have attracted. But no, the same solitude which has so long reigned within these walls, still continued to spread its gloom around. It was remarked, that the Pisaroni is too serious in the character, and yet in the air Pensa alla patria, she was very effective; it is an air well calculated to show off her unrivalled power of expression. Galli, for whom the part of the Turk was originally written, sung with spirit; but no other excellency can atone for the nasal defects in his voice, Poor Graziani did all she could for the part she has to perform ; the wags say she is quite at home in the finale, Sono come una cornacchia, che spennaia fa erd, era! M. Spontini is at this moment engaged in exercising his talents on the drama of Faust. Thus we see an Italian, settled in Germany, opposed to a native, who is so highly esteemed by his countryman!

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be.

Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning.

He refused the offer and hastened to the capital; there it was necessary he should live: an organist’s place would furnish him with the means; there was a vacancy at the church of Sazat Paul ; it was to be filled up by election; Rameau was a candidate ; his opponent, Dagnin, was successful; he was obliged to leave Paris; an organist was required for the church of Saint Etienne at Lille, where he also offered himself and was accepted; but he only remained a short time in this town.

At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.']",Danjou,Q444728,person,Q37120631,Q37120631,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'J.P. respectfully acquaints amateurs arid flate players generally, that he continues to manufacture his greatly admired tutes, which have given so much satisfaction to the profession, and to all who have awarded to his instruments the preference.

Thesedrawbacks are observable throughout Demophon: in these days the talent which is exercised under similar unfavourable circumstances, produces but mediocrity. From time to time we perceive the commencement of a happy melody in this work, such, for example, as the air, Faut il enfin que je déclare, and that of Au plaisir de voir tant de charmes, &c.; but the detestable verses, so-styled lyrics of Marmontel, soon chase away the melodious perfume which we were about to inhale. Poor Cherubini knew not what to do with these variously formed measures which sometimes conipelled him to make his phrases of five bars and sometimes but of three or constrained him to augment the value of musical times, to make two bars of one.

It would be unfortunate if Services were produced on the model of “ Symphonic Poems.” Yet compositions of the latter class having their admirers must necessarily in time be a source of disintegration. It is, therefore, with especial pleasure that legitimists must view the continued labours of musicians such as Mr. Henry Smart, who regard true progress as the development of past excellence, not the abrogation of tradition and the deification of ourselves. At the same time we must observe that great care should be exercised to make works of this class irreproachable from a literary point of view. Too often we perceive indications that the study of “letters” is sacrificed in a zealous application to that of “notes.” Language, as the incentive of musical thought, demands equal consideration with the melody to which it is allied, nor can we forgive the musician who shows himself to be unscholarly. Dr. Stewart has brought about good reforms at Dublin, an example which our own Universities might well follow in considering the requirements to be exacted from candidates for musical degrees.

Oo First on the list stands the chapel master, Fioravanti. ‘This composer, whose operas are known, liked, and esteemed all over Europe, was called to this place soon after the departure of ‘Zingarelli for Naples. At that time he began: to abandon the career of the theatre, where his works, full of merit from their simplicity, their perfect modulation, and their true and original expression, had obtained for him the reputation of a celebrated master, above all incomic operas. The ingenious caprices which often make him disdain, ordinary forms, his real humour, his piquant sallies, his ingenious caricatures, give a very peculiar stamp to his scores. As the vivacity of his imagination is always guided and tempered by reason, his theatrical works may be recommended to the study of scholars without restriction. His recitativo parlante has not been since surpassed. His.compositions for the church, which are only written for one or two choirs en account of their destination, deserve more favour than they appear to obtain.

He declared that since this noble institution, the receipt for the poor amounted every time to 40 or 50 francs, whilst formerly it never exceeded ten.— Diffcile est satyram non scribere. £8 ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF MUSIC IN ROME.', 'The admiration of some persons was unlimited ; others only granted to the author of Lodoiska the knowledge of which they were no judges, but refused him any genius, At the time when these disputes began, the Italian compositions of the master were only known to a very small number of musicians, and the merits of the French operas of the celebrated composer were alone discussed, but so violently, that I remember to have heard, in the dressing-room of the Opera Comique, a challenge given on the subject.']",Pergolesi,Q185312,person,Q21510201,Q21510201,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Might not the common aims of both be better promoted by an union of interests ? The theatres have produced little novelty: this year. The presentation of Mr. Sinclair, “ on his arrival from Italy,” as the court circular says, has been the principal]. A ‘correspondent in the first article of our last Number (page 10 of this volume) has drawn a pretty accurate outline of this gentleman’ s improvements by foreign travel. He demonstrates in a manner not to be mistaken, the erroneous ‘notion that after a certain period of life a_ new style may be formed or engrafted upon an old one. 'Whenever this has been done, it has been done, we will venture to affirm, only by persons of more than ordinary intellect, and of profound judgment and of considerable’ self-knowledge. . Mr. Sinclair has gathered up exotic graces without number and without assimilation ; his singing is truly “‘an unweeded garden,” or to sum up all in one phrase, it exhibits the very best specimen of the very worst taste it ever fell to our lot to hear.

His writings are chiefly .histerical notes upon the progress “of the operatic, as seen in the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, and in the coneatenations of Meyerbeer, Berlioz, and Wagner. He takes credit for having at first sight: discerned the merits of Gounod, and he has uniformly pressed the works of this composer upon the attention of his readers. Many would not agree witheall that he has written upon Gounod; but he prophesied the success of the Faust, and as his prophecy was fulfilled, he has, so far, the best of\'the argument. W. hen Mr. Chorley first came before the public as an operatic critic, the Italian Opera was siniply a grand display of song; the singers were all in al’, the band was of small importance, and the scenery a mere thing of shreds and patches. Pasta and Malibran, Ru- bini and Lablache, cared nothing ‘for scenery""; and two fiddles and a bass would have been quite etiough for.all their wants in the way of -aceompaniment.

But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.', 'WE regret to have to announce the sudden death, from heart disease, of Dr. H.

There is indeed in the mind of this youth, (for he is, we understand, even now a mere youth,) indications of powerful talent, of which the piece before us is one instance. Of the justice of our praise, we cannot bring a stronger proof, than that having placed it before a young lady to play, and a gentleman to sing, who had never before seen the song, they were both so affected as to be unable to go throughit.

Purcell’s great fame is, as we have before remarked, and now fearlessly repeat, founded on his productions for the theatre and the chamber : in his compositions for the church, he met with equals in his ewn country and superiors abroad ; and when his anthems are compared-with those of his successors,—those of Clark, Croft, Green, and Boyce,—though the science displayed ‘in many of them, and the study which some have cost, will readily be granted, yet in melody, in pleasing combinations, and above all, in that judgment which dictates how sounds should be adapted to sense, it will be in vain that his admirers attempt to rank him with such of his followers as we have named, and who possessed advantages that seemed to have been denied to composers at the close of the seventeenth century.""]",Purcell,Q9695,person,Q16881491,Q16881491,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

In_deed he appears to write but very little, and this perhaps may be “partly accounted for by his well known love for general learning, and by the eclat which always attends his performance on the organ. Writing in the style our author has adopted, is a laborious task to all; but his extemporancous flights, though unatiainable by others, cost him nothing, and are well caiculated to ebstract him frony the drudgery of the desk and the waste of “ midnight oil.” Guar readers will easily imagine that the service now under consideration, coming from one so well acquainted with the writings of the greatest church composers, is distinguished by sweet and appropriate melody in many places—The harmony likewise is often very pure, and the modulations are truly ecclesiastical ; but the chief excellence of this composition arises from a total absence of all that is vulgar or theatrical. In it we discover no lack-a-daisical chromatics nor. stage effects, but the whole flows on with that simplicity which should ever be the leading characteristic of music which is intended for the service of the temple.', ""Tus very interesting little work. is, to the best of our belief, new alike in idea and execution. Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'ought, they are se amusing. But this last may be aeeounted for. The composer had, possibly, some crotchets in his head, and straightway whipt them into an album,a real one, white and unspotted: but, forgetting that said whipping-in had turned the said album black, neglected to change its designation with its change of colour. N’importe, however: what is a name ?—The beautiful glee by Lord Mornington, “ Here in cool grot,” which Mr. Cramer has taken as the ground-work of his present agreeable publication—(where, by-the-by, do we now meet with such glees?)—-would sound just as well under the name of canon, or hymn, and his charming arrangement of it, would be quite as pleasing had it been made by a Mr. Jones, or a Mr. Groans.

On a public occasion, when M.

Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", ""Moscheles, speaking in one of his letters of a concert at his own house, adds, ‘‘Malibran and De Bériot appeared at eleven o’clock, afler our eighty guests had satisfied their musical appetite. with English vocal music, solos by Lipinsky and Servais, and my own ‘Concert Fantastique.’ She looked weary, and, when she sang, one scarcely recognized Malibran, she was so voiceless, heard subsequently that she had been thrown from her horse, when riding in the park.

The applause was unanimous and vociferous to all these pieces, but, we must confess, that we vastly preferred M. Sivori’s performance of his own concerlo, and that of De Beriot, to the two other morceaus, which displayed less of really skilful playing than showy frivolities ; astonishing, no doubt, to such as did not understand the secret of their execution, but presenting very slight interest to the amateur of the violin.

Anti-Puff will, therefore, feel surprised to hear that Mr. Cohan has been favourably noticed and duly appreciated by the following highly esteemed journals Re Bera, the Sun, the Argus, the Britannia, mngay Times, the Globe, the Age, once by orning Post itself; aud, though last, not least, by the Afuszeal Examiner—a tolerably fair criterion of the gentleman’s merits. Now, if Anti-Puff’s presumption be a correct one, then all the editors of the above independent journals have criticised the performances of Mr. Cohan without ever having heard him, and his assertion amounts to a stronger satire ugainst newspaper criticism in general than that of Mr. Cohan, or even the renowned Jenkins himself. But, Mr. Editor, is Anti-Puff to be allowed with impunity to make go palpably gross and false a declaration? Are we to believe that the leading journals of the day would barter their acknowledged principles of integrity and independence for mere favour or pecuniary reward from 4 simple individual, and speak highly of his attainments, when, according to Anti-Puffs version of the affair, he po~sesses no real talent to support it.', 'Mr. Colman, in his preface to this play, thus feelingly and eloquently alludes to an event which deprived the world of a genius, and himself of a most intimate and valued friend.—‘* Nay, even the composer of the musicand here let.me breathe a sigh to the memory of departed worth and genius, as I write the name of Storace—even he could not preside in his department.

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be.

The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'It may perhaps by many persons be considered an ungracious and invidious task to search out errors in the writings of men eminent for their talent, learning, or science ; but all those who know anything of the philosophy of the arts must be aware that something more than general learning and classical erudition is required of him who would lay down rules for principles of taste in harmony, or, in short, of any department of the art of music, wherein nothing but a long course of study, both in its theory and practice, can bestow the power to rectify abuses, or establish any certain improvement in its system.

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose?

In saying this, reference is more especially made to the second part of the chorus, “‘and that He made the world so fast that it cannot be moved,” where the grand employment of one repeated note produces a no less. fine effect than in “ For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it,” in the Messiah, or ‘The floods stood upright as a heap,” inIsvael.

It is to be regretted that, at present, these anthems are, with a few exceptions, only to be had in the score editions of Arnold and the German Handel Society; it is much to be desired that their publication, in a cheap and convenient form, may soon render them more generally accessible.']",Spohr,Q57226,person,Q21510686,Q21510686,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Indeed, we question whether a finer performance has ever been given in this country, where, strangely enough, it seems to have taken a firmer root than in Germany. We need scarcely say that the movement, which so many insist upon terming the “scherzo,” was encored. Mendelssohn’s ** Lauda Sion’’—in deference to Exeter Hail audiences, called ‘Praise Jehovah ”—did not show the choir at its best ; and, indeed, it may be said that a body of vocalists 60 Constantly trained to give effect to the massive grandeur of Handel, can scarcely, perhaps, be equally successful in interpreting the more delicately shaded choral pieces of Mendelssohn. On this occasion, however, we must bring a graver charge against the singers, for, in many parts, the intonation was so flat as to cause discomfort to the listeners; and, in consequence of this, much of the best music passed almost unnoticed. Madame Nouver, Miss Julia Elton, Mr. Pearson, and Mr. QO. Christian, however, gave valuable assistance in the solos ; and their efforts were warmly appreciated. Handel's Coronation Anthem,“ Zadok, the Priest,’ was the concluding piece; and the choristers here again proved their efficiency, leaving a good impression upon those who did not retire after the ‘‘ Lauda Sion.” The hall was crowded in every part."", '8. “O come, let us sing unto the Lord.” —This is again a somewhat unequal work. It contains some of Handel’s greatest choral writing ; the opening chorus, founded on the fifth Gregorian tone, is splendid throughout; and the third chorus, “Tell it out among the heathen” (part of which he subsequently re-arranged for Belshazzar), is one of those wonderful movements in which the old master has never been approached. In saying this, reference is more especially made to the second part of the chorus, “‘and that He made the world so fast that it cannot be moved,” where the grand employment of one repeated note produces a no less. fine effect than in “ For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it,” in the Messiah, or ‘The floods stood upright as a heap,” inIsvael. The lovely tenor song, ‘‘O come, let us worship,” with two flutes doubling the violins in the octave above, is also fully worthy of Handel. This song, by the way, was taken from his opera, Silla, where it is to be found with the same orchestration. The other pieces of this anthem are by no means equal to those already named, the songs especially being, to our modern tastes, decidedly tedious.', 'ably one of thé -veteran -conrpeser’s finest choral citement of the time and the occasion, _just.as, in another way, A.

But I have too much sense of propriety to shew my reading by trespassing so much on your valuable space, and therefore I shall content myself with glancing at the musicians; indeed it will be sufficient for my purpose if I select him whose name stands at the head of this letter. How common it is to hear Rossini called “ the child of Fore tune”—the spoiled child, according to some—“ the most lucky fellow” that ever put pen to music paper, and other epithets which shew the sensation produced by his brilliant and extraordinary career. Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

De Begnis in -Bartolo—Pellegrini in Figaro—and Porto in Don Basilio, were almost equally admirable, making the necessary allowance for what each had to do. De Begnis was inimitable.

On his arrival at Fiorence, to which city he had been invited, crowds of ladies and gentlemen went. three miles out of the city to meet him, as they would have done to receive a Prince. On. one occasion, after performing the character of Zefiro, in London, he was presented, bya person in a mask, with an emerald of great value. There is a ‘portrait of him, with. the following profane motto surrounding it, instead of an inscription :—gui fecit mirabilia multa; and alsoa ‘medal, on, one side of which was his head, crowned with laurel, and on the other, a swan dying on the banks of the Meander, with the lyre of Arion, who descends from heaven. The second was ‘Ti Cavaliere Don Carlo Broschi, otherwise called Farinelli. He was born in Naples, where he studied the rudiments of music under Alessandro Scarlatti and Nicolo Porpora. These instructors soon developed his wonderful talents for singing. No one in our times has possessed a more powerful, flexible, sonorous, and extensive compass of voice. He could pass with equal rapidity from the lowest to the highest notes in his scale, and a_ creative fancy, joined to great flexibility of organ, enabled him to create a thousand new and eccentric styles of singing. ‘To natural qualifications he added those of art, perfect intonation, an incom_ parable shake, purity and beauty of ornament, equal excellence in the light and pathetic styles, and above all, the finest possible _messa di voce, ‘All these ‘wonderful qualities were universally ascribed to him, and no one can be ignorant of the high success which they gained him.

The fault lies principally 1 in the backwardness of the age and the people. _ Storace was a man of unquestionable genius, but he introduced more than he invented, being contented rather to strive to create a good taste than to write original music, Perhaps he saw the rock on which his predecessors were shattered.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'have effected all this is certainly Mr. Novello’s praise. And if the love of music and the judgment in the science, which are uni-versally attributed to the inhabitants of Catholic countries, be ina great measure owing to the frequency of hearing the finest compo-.— sitions in attending the duties of their religion, we may hope that the adoption of these pieces into the choirs of Catholic chapels ia England, may assist in forming the taste of many of our own countrymen. The way in which the service is performed at such places of worship in London is become a source of high and unusual attraction, and the chapels are constantly crowded by persons of other persuasions, who attend expressly to hear the musica fact well worth the consideration of those who have the direction of Protestant cathedrals. It has fallen to our lot to excite much attention to the subject of church music, both as regards the Catholic and the Protestant faith ; and by the communications,* now Jaying before us, it should seem that the influence of discussion has been beneficial, and is likely to be still more so to the interests of religion as well as of music. : .

Nothing affects the imagination more than church music. Nor are its effects confined to minds of a higher class ; for we may observe them. extend to all. The members of the ‘Romish church, aware of this circumstance, have never failed to call in harmony to aid their most solemn rites; and though, on some occasions, they may have carried the use of it to excess, we ~~ should do well to consider, whether this divine art ‘might not be ‘yendered more available than it now is, in heightening the in- terest of our own form of worship.

Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', '%, CH.

Signor Placci sung very little—no song indeed—and if Mr. Kellner had been so curtailed, the audience would not have complained.

By Orlando Steed. By the title-page we perceive that this is a lecture delivered at the Town Hall, Sudbury, and we can conscientiously say that were most of the lectures we are compelled to listen to only half as thoughtful and earnest, there would be little need for. the addition of those “illustrations ” without which such discourses are considered in the present day to offer no attraction to the general public. Mr. Steed, although a conscientious artist, is evidently not a musical fanatic, for he wisely commences his address by ing upon his hearers the necessity of enlarging the mind by a study of all arts, in order to work reverently and seriously in any one. “ Not long ago,” he says “ Mr. Ella tells us, at a discussion upon Musical Education at the Society of Arts, painter, a Royal Academician, who had received_his education gratuitously, repudiated the idea of State aid for music on the ground that it was not worthy of being called an art at all. This want of comprehensiveness in those who are considered to belong to the educated classes was doubtless the cause of Channing's pregnant query, ‘Did you ever know a senior wrangler who wasn’t a fool?’ which conveys the incontrovertible truth that exclusive or undue devotion to any kind of study, however legitimate or beneficial, cannot but cramp the powers of the intellect and narrow the sympathies of the mind.” This is indeed true; and were it not for the firm belief a real lover of his art has in what Mr. Steed calls the “moral influence” of muzic, the chance would be small of ita eventually making its way through the mist of ignorance which surrounds it. Pursuing his subject logically, illustrating his positions with much acuteness, and occasionally in most felicitous language, our author very ably proves that music is of all arts most spontaneous, the germs of vocal music, indeed, being inseparable from articulation. “I must repeat,” he says, “that while the organs for the production of effects upon the ear are innate to man, he has to go out of himself, as it were, to obtain the means of appealing tothe eye. Poetry and vocal music are born with him ; architecture, painting and sculpture, can only be practised when he has found out the use of tools.” We regret that we have not space to follow Mr. Steed through the principal points of his very able lecture, but we cannot refrain from quoting some of his remarks respecting those who should be employed. as instructors of youthful pupils, because we are certain that so much misapprehension exists upon this matter that the sooner the truth is spoken the better. “The custom,” he says, “of having incompetent teachers for the young, in the hope that a more capable and expensive one will be able to put things right by and by, is another frequent cause for want of success. The rudiments ofthe art, unless correctly acquired at first, are rarely learnt at all. A bad position of the hands, and numberless other faults, if long persisted in, \x0c will stick to a pupil in spite of all the efforts of after years.” And, speaking of eminent solo performers being engaged as ‘ he writes thus :—“ Great players, independently of their disinclination, are seldom possessed of the requisite qualifications for jeaching beginners of only average talent; _« « « they can hardly be expected to sacrifice the maintenance of their executive proficiency, and their study of the higher branches of the art, in order to make themselves acquainted with the best method of teaching children their notes, and of arousing their dormant sensibilities.” Pre«cisely; bat the delusion that-they will do so is so common that it will require many years to root it out, especially with those parents and guardians who are themselves utterly ignorant of the subject for which they seek instruction. Meanwhile, however, it is good that the question should be ventilated whenever an opportunity arises ; and Mr. Steed deserves every credit for the manner in which he hes boldly come forward to challenge this, as well as many othér conventional shams, connected with the art."", 'enthusiasm is not his liné, and he delights rather in summing up tersely, quaintly, - and sometimes sarcastically. Occasionally he is somewhat too dogmatic. ; more rarely his manner verges on the supercilious. ‘Mr. Chorley generally ignores the church, and his: musical standpoint is therefore the opera. His writings are chiefly .histerical notes upon the progress “of the operatic, as seen in the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, and in the coneatenations of Meyerbeer, Berlioz, and Wagner. He takes credit for having at first sight: discerned the merits of Gounod, and he has uniformly pressed the works of this composer upon the attention of his readers. Many would not agree witheall that he has written upon Gounod; but he prophesied the success of the Faust, and as his prophecy was fulfilled, he has, so far, the best of\'the argument. W. hen Mr. Chorley first came before the public as an operatic critic, the Italian Opera was siniply a grand display of song; the singers were all in al’, the band was of small importance, and the scenery a mere thing of shreds and patches. Pasta and Malibran, Ru- bini and Lablache, cared nothing ‘for scenery""; and two fiddles and a bass would have been quite etiough for.all their wants in the way of -aceompaniment. There was no Costa and no Arditi in‘those days, and Pasta would probably have treated the conductor as irreverently as old Cra-mer addressed the obese Doctor, Philip Hayes.', 'On Tuesday the 27th June, at a convocation holden in Durham, the Rev. W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.']",Coward,Q5719907,person,Q16865821,Q16865821,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand. To.', 'hard style, but always showing an intelligent appreciation of the dramatic exigencies of the part. In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.']",Verdi,Q7317,person,Q37231923,Q37231923,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Moreover, Rossini, though he may never have read the e says of Lord Bacon, must be instinctively aware of what that great man asserted, with as much eloquence as truth, in regard to popularity: viz., that the multitude worship the rising rather than the se¢- ting sun.

A similar observation was made with respect to the great Abbey festival of 1791, where the power, nevertheless, was above double that of the York band, and ina more contracted space.

However this might be, Rossini received new proofs of admiration from the superintendent of the royal theatres, who, in order -to prevail on him to remain at Naples, constituted him director of the theatres S. Carlo and del Fondo; but Rossini shewed at Naples the same indifference he has since displayed at the Theatre Italien in Paris. In 1817 he gave his Armida, which did not fulfil the expectations of the public; this opera was written in the style of Jomelli, whose “score was probably under his eyes, consequently its success was of a very short duration. But his reputation, already warmly disputed by his adversaries, suffered nothing. In the following year he made a little excursion to Rome, to bring out his Adelaide di Borgogna at the Argentina ; on his return to Naples he wrote his Mosé, which obtained an immense success ; for, independently of the very considerable receipts which it produced, no other ‘music was sung throughout Italy. Enthusiasm was never before excited to such a point. The praises of his genius, and the incomparable work full of life and originality which had just crowned his labours, resounded from all parts. ‘Towards the end of the same year, 1818, a farce called Adina, intended for the theatre St. Charles of Lisbon, paid well, and preceded Ricciardo and Zoraide, which had also immense success, and filled all the connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs with a general delirium. It was then that the famous epistle of Cimarosa appeared, dated from the Elysian fields, which elevated Rossini’s music to the skies, and ranked. him amongst the greatest geniuses that Italy could boast. The interpreter of love, Paisiello, the tender and impassioned Piccini, exclaimed with delight on seeing this work, and applauded it before the Gods. There is a discussion between Durante and Jomelli on two acts of this opera. Some reproaches are addressed to him relative to his melodies, as well as different observations, which interest us no more than they did Rossini himself. In 1819. Ermione was written for St. Carlo in the same style ; but this opera produced but little effect. Soon after he set off for Venice, where his Kdoardo e Cristina was brought out. This opera had only a few new pieces, all the rest ‘were taken from others. In the autumn of the same year, he wrote for St. Carlo La Donna del Lago, which gained him new \x0c AO ON THE “ACTUAL STATE oF MUSIC IN NAPLES. .', ""The greater part of the ‘“‘ Gloria’? must be pronounced by no means worthy of Schubert’s reputation. It is effective and brilliant music, full of tune, as is everything from its composer's pen; but the first movement might almost be called absolutely commonplace. The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

Thus far then has Wagner influenced us for good; and whatever may be the ultimate fate of his works in England, there can be little doubt of the truth of his conviction that the composer has a higher mission than that of administering to the frivolous taste of a frivolous audience. “Lohengrin? must not be accepted as the latest emThere may beand probably is—as much difference between ‘‘ Lohengrin ” and the ‘“* Ring des Niebeliingen ” (which has not yet been heard), as there is between ‘Der Fliegende Hollander ” and Lohengrin.” Wagner’s books must be consulted by all who wish to trace the growth of the idea which has ruled his artistic life; but the result of his philosophy may be found in his Operas, and so progressively developed as to convince even those who disagree with him of the singleness of purpose with which he has worked.

There are too many passing-notes. in the harmonizations of Bach; Mendelssohn’s, however, always show exquisite taste. Some esteem his oratorio ‘*Elijah” higher than that of ‘‘St. Paul.” As a later production ‘‘Elijah” is indeed more powerful in its entire formation ; but it is not so fresh, and for this reason ‘St. Paul’ will always be more cherished by suchas prefer vigor and spirit to knowledge and science.""]",Lortzing,Q154203,person,Q108515006,Q108515006,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

The French dramatic style has gradually introduced itself into the Italian Opera ; and it is to Rossini, wonderfully seconded by the flexible and fine toned base voices he has had to write for, that we owe such works: as Otello, La Gazza Ladra, Mosé, &c., where scenic effect is happily blended with the charms of melody, and that of the orchestra with the rich tones of the human voice. The introduction of base voices into the serious opera, the execution of the bold and brilliant passages, written for them in comic parts, has regenerated the Italian Opera, which was simply a concert dramatized ; while the Italian singers, feeling how much the effect of music may be aided by scenic illusion, have, for the most part, become excellent actors. In short, we may say, that to hear such an opera as La Gazza Ladra performed by such singers as Rubini, Tamburini, Lablache, Graziani, Malibran, and Mariano, is the perfection of dramatic music.']",Rossini,Q9726,person,Q21493186,Q21493186,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

It is, therefore, with especial pleasure that legitimists must view the continued labours of musicians such as Mr. Henry Smart, who regard true progress as the development of past excellence, not the abrogation of tradition and the deification of ourselves. At the same time we must observe that great care should be exercised to make works of this class irreproachable from a literary point of view. Too often we perceive indications that the study of “letters” is sacrificed in a zealous application to that of “notes.” Language, as the incentive of musical thought, demands equal consideration with the melody to which it is allied, nor can we forgive the musician who shows himself to be unscholarly.

This will at least explain how our remarks are confined to its separate con‘sideration. Though containing no conspicuous points of interest, this number will grow into popularity by repetition, and as hearers become more familiar with music which, apart from its melodious and musicianly character, is replete with evidences that its author throws aside opportunities of ad captandum effects in his desire to combine a faithful rendering of the text with a legitimate use Of the resources of his art; Much as we advocate the necessity that English Church Music should progress with the spirit of the time, there are many signs of a growing tendency to introduce effects having a palpable kinship with the realism which is the prominent feature of the latest forms of programme music. It would be unfortunate if Services were produced on the model of “ Symphonic Poems.” Yet compositions of the latter class having their admirers must necessarily in time be a source of disintegration. It is, therefore, with especial pleasure that legitimists must view the continued labours of musicians such as Mr. Henry Smart, who regard true progress as the development of past excellence, not the abrogation of tradition and the deification of ourselves. At the same time we must observe that great care should be exercised to make works of this class irreproachable from a literary point of view. Too often we perceive indications that the study of “letters” is sacrificed in a zealous application to that of “notes.” Language, as the incentive of musical thought, demands equal consideration with the melody to which it is allied, nor can we forgive the musician who shows himself to be unscholarly. Dr. Stewart has brought about good reforms at Dublin, an example which our own Universities might well follow in considering the requirements to be exacted from candidates for musical degrees. Mr. Smart has certainly not committed very egregious faults in this direction; and indeed, we might be content to pass them by, if they proceeded from the penof aless prominent musician, whose example might be in little danger of creating precedents.

Of all the parts of her singing, the execution of ornaments and passages sotto voce is the most beautiful. She carries the power of ductility to its utmost possible perfection, and we must give her in this respect a praise equal to.any vocalist we ever remember, Madame Pasta is celebrated for the comparative plainness of her style,* and for the good taste and invention displayed in her ornaments and in their application. This is true in the general, but there are few who can be more florid than she can be and sometimes is. The song of all others which has attracted most attention since-she has been in England, ~~ is the celebrated entrata of Tancredi, “‘ Oh. Patria,” and the popular air which follows it, “‘ Tu che accendi.” There is scarcely a single passage from the beginning to the end of it, that she does not absolutely change. Whether Mad. Pasta, considering how frequently this song has been repeated, thought it necessary to produce a striking variety we know not, but it seems to us that no other reason can justify so complete a departure from the composer’s notes. For though we award to Mad. P. the praise of having demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity, we are by no ‘ means so ready to admit that her alterations ‘improve the song.', 'To sum up her attributes then—she has a fine sensibility and a just conception—an intonation seldom incorrect—execution perfected and regulated by profound science. Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be. Her recitativo parlante i is far above that of most performers, and we must repeat that her entire manner exhibits the force of sensibility, intellect, and science, in the use of organic powers generally speaking far below those possessed by singers of so high a class. .']",Viardot,Q122998,person,Q980636;Q24514422,Q24514422,0,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

He says—“ Aprés avoir entendu la priére de Roméo et Juliette, épreuve décisive pour le talent d’une _cantatrice ; aprés avoir reconnu comment Mademoiselle Pasta sait chanter dz portamento, comment elle nuance les ports de voix, comment elle sait accentuer, lier et soutenir avec égalité un long période vocal, je ne fais nul doute que Rossini ne consente a lui sacrifier une partie de son systéme, et 4 élaguer un peu la forét de petites notes qui surchargent ses cantilenes."", '“6 J E céde A Ja tentation d’essayer un portrait musicale de Mademoiselle Pasta. On peut dire qu’il n’y eut jamais d’entreprise plus difficile; le langage musical est ingrat et insolite ; 4 chaque instant les mots vont me manquer ; et quand j’aurais le bonheur d’en trouver pour exprimer ma pensée, ils présenteraient un sens peu clair 4 esprit du lecteur. D/ailleurs il n’est peut-¢tre pas un dillettante qui n’ait sa phrase toute faite sur Mademoiselle Pasta, et qui ne soit mécontent de ne pas la retrouver ici; et dans Ja juste admiration que cette grande cantatrice inspire au public, le lecteur le plus bienveillant trouvera son portrait sans couleur, et mille fois au-dessous de ce qu’il attendait.”” ° If such are the difficulties which the biographer of Haydn, Mozart, and Rossini, anticipated—if he who appears to have passed the larger portion of his life in following and observing the great’ public singers of his age, feared to encounter them in attempting to describe this celebrated female, our dismay should be infinitely increased. For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.', 'To sum up her attributes then—she has a fine sensibility and a just conception—an intonation seldom incorrect—execution perfected and regulated by profound science. Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be. Her recitativo parlante i is far above that of most performers, and we must repeat that her entire manner exhibits the force of sensibility, intellect, and science, in the use of organic powers generally speaking far below those possessed by singers of so high a class. .']",Mozart,Q254,person,Q18574758,Q18574758,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

In 1829, as everybody knows, Mendelssohn first visited this country, bringing with him his Overture to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” his String Quartet in A', 'minor, and other works. Moscheles had just then lost his eldest boy, and his diary gives us a charming glimpse of Mendelssohn’s sympathetic nature :—“ As a friend, he is of untold value; cheerful, yet full of sympathy with us in our recent loss, and our anxiety for the frail treasure still left to us; he is always ready to exchange the attractions of London for our rural solitude, where his society acts like healing balm on our wounded spirits. He seems to have set himself the task of compensating us for our sufferings.” With this quick and generous nature was still joined the modesty of the boy :—‘ How delightful it is,” wrote Moscheles, ‘when he brings some of his new compositions, and, after playing them, waits with child-like modesty for an expression of my opinion. Any other would long since have become aware that in him I recognize my own master, and that Iam in raptures where he ts expecting to be sharply criticised. Do what I will to give him a correct view and appreciation of our relative positions, he always insists upon subordinating himself to me as his master.” This is charming as regards Mendelssohn ; hardly so as regards Moscheles, who, in his enthusiasm, did all that was possible to ruin the modesty he admired.

To which was added a better cadence, according to the Lullian taste, all superfluities were removed, more precision and spirit were, given to the time and measure, and the overtures to many Italian operas were composed alla Francese. This custom lasted for more than twenty years, until the beginning of the present century, - and it is easy.to disprove what the Italians assert » to the contrary, by referring to the music written at that period.', 'Messrs. Cook and Lucas also played concertos, of their own composition, on their respective instruments, the oboe and. violoncello, and were both much applauded.

We may here casually remark, that Mr. Novello differs in a point of history and chronology from others, and as it appears to us erro+ neously. .He says—‘ Leo in every respect eminently advanced the progress of his art; that which his master Scarlatti began, he continued ; and he completed that which, before him, Porpora and Sala only indicated.” eo was born at Naples in 1694, and died of apoplexy, in his Slst year, in 1745, The time of Sala’s birth is not precisely stated, but as he did not die till 1800, though he is stated to have been nearly 100 years old, it should still seem that he must have succeeded Leo, whose pupil he is stated to have been. So late indeed as 1794 he published his prodigiously ela- borate work on composition, the expence being defrayed by the King of Naples, which was soon after destroyed. M. Choron has however re-embodied the bulk of his examples in his “ Principes de Composition.” It does. therefore appear that Sala came after Leo, though knowing the careful accuracy of the Editor of the Fitzwilliam Music, we should almost be inelined to Suspeet the sources from which we draw our correction.', 'He therefore confided to Salieri the task of composing the opera of Les Danaides,” for this city, which Salieri did under his superinteridance, and adopted so happily the style of the composer for whom he was writing, that the deception succeeded completely, and at Paris he was believed only to have taken a Part in the third act. Salieri came there with his opera in 1784; it was performed several times before the Royal Family, the Oucen herself singing in it. Atlength it was brought out with the highest success at the great theatre, and it was not till after the thirteenth representation, when Gluck printed an address to the public declaring who was its author, that Salieri was known to be the composer. Very substantial remuneration followed this discovery, and the directors of the opera charged him with the composition of the opera of “ The Horatii and Curiatit.” A short time after this, Salieri composed the opera of “Axus, King of Ormus,” for which the Emperor Joseph II. presented him with two hundred ducats, and settled upon him a pension of three hundred.

GADE.', 'On Thursday, Miss Hughes took her benefit, and a new opera called Nadir and Zuleika was produced ; the music _partly selected, partly composed by Mr. Horn. Of course, the piece is of an eastern character. The music is light, pretty, and well suited to the sentiment. The plot is rather extravagant ; turning upon no less than the opium day-dream of Nadir, a young gentleman who has expressed a wish to become acquainted with the lovely houris; or black-eyed beauties of Mahomet’s heaven; and this being overheard by Zuleika, a young lady who imagines that her charms are sufficient to ensure him a terrestrial paradise, she resents his conduct by dosing him and his servant with opium ; and then gets up a scene during his bewilderment, which causes him to believe, that he really has thrown off ‘ this mortal coil,’ and is in possession of his wish. A number of droll circumstances and situations arise, which we have not space to dwell on: suffice it to say, that it is a lively operetta of the Abon Hassan’ species ; and, like that piece, has an admirable part for Placie, which he makes the most of; indeed, he is extremely droll, and kept the house in constant laughter. The overture is composed by Fetis, a person who stands high as a critic in Paris, and editor of a musical journal. Mr. Horn has’ likewise used the chorus Tacete non temete, by Mercadante, as found in his opera Le Nonne de Gamache. It is also introduced in Elise e Claudio. To this he has added a second subject skilfully, and, we think, has increased its effect. A ballad, founded on a Swiss air, sung by Miss Hughes, is a charming little gem; and was executed by her extremely well, and deservingly encored. She had likewise a bravura, with a corno and clarinette accompaniment. The former instrument was clumsily managed, the latter had not enough to do; but Herwig never fails in his part; and what he had to play was perfect. We do not admire this bravura ; the divisions are common-place, and such as we have heard five hundred times with all the clap-traps and gallery-delights commonly used; but Horn has instrumented the song with his usual ability. Jones has two songs, both good ; the last a very beautiful air, tov chaste perhaps to please the multitude; but it comes in a bad situation, directly after the former noisy song. Ano_ ther place should be found, or dialogue introduced between the two. The choruses are pleasing, and they sang, particularly the ladies, admirably. Richings sustained the character of Vivienne, a French officer brought into the east we really forget for what purpose. He acted naturally, and there was nothing in the concerted music beyond his capability. After the opera, the excellent piece of ‘Ways and Means’ was performed; and between the acts the band played out of the book number siz, which the house immediately recognized, and hissed most profoundly. Horn’s pretty ballad, the Mermaid’s Cave, followed, sung by Miss Hughes, and accompanied by himself; it was received with its usual éclaé. The opera of John of Paris concluded the evening, which was done much more perfectly than before.—-(New York Mirror.)']",Gade,Q154632,person,Q16870075,Q16870075,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.902158273381295,0.8450134770889488,0.872651356993737

Moreover, Rossini, though he may never have read the e says of Lord Bacon, must be instinctively aware of what that great man asserted, with as much eloquence as truth, in regard to popularity: viz., that the multitude worship the rising rather than the se¢- ting sun. Next to Rossini ranks the composer of La Muette de Portici, and Fra Diavolo—creations that will live for ever—creations that place Auber among those, whom fame will not allow to be forgotten; but their greatness has been rather dimmed than lustred, by the subsequent productions of their author. In fact, Auber though a gifted is not a great man; he renders the interests of his art subservient to his own he thinks fast—writes carelessly— and grows rich—but effects little or nothing now, (though he seldom brings forward less than two-operas annually), towards the advancement of music asascience. Yet, let us be grateful for what he has ettected —enough in all conscience to smother censure ; let us snatch the seattered beauties that abound in his Gustave—his Bayaderehis Philtre--his Lestocq—his Ambassadrice—his Diamans de la Couronne—and above all, his Domino Noir—operas replete with elegance, though wanting in the uni¢y and connected design of his two great works, Meverbeer comes next, with his romantic and grotesque giganticisms, (in which the inexhaustible genius of Scribe, that polyglot among dramatists, shines almost as preeminently as his own)— Rovert /e Diable, Les Huguenots—leviathans, vast, terrible, mis-shapenwith their universe of scenic effect—their volcanic masses of sound—painfully exciting—fatiguing to the mind—marked by a feverish restlessness which gives no repose to the mind’s ear. Consider them as works of art—strip them of their academical habiliments—their grand and fiery orchestra—their voluptuous 4a//e¢—their dazzling decorations and enchanting scenery‘alter the mise en scene—and in their nakedness, they would scarcely bear the eagle eye of' strict analysis—they would become rich prey for the soured spirit of the critic—and, in fact, would lose half their grandeur, with their clothingtheir effect, so brilliant, so imposing, being but the result of abstract ornament. To speak plainly, the operas of Meyerbeer—though often evincing indications of genius—regarded as scientific creations, can only be classed among second rate productions. Yet FE must confess that in alluding to them, I can well afford to exclaim with Horace: ~Uhi plura niteut in carmine non ego paucis Offendar maculis.”’ After these three, and only after them, from the fact that, as vet, he has not distinguished himself as a dramatic composer, I should place Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy,* the king of faéry music--the magician of dreams—whose glowing and exuberant imagination is so remarkably developed in his orchestral overtures; his sfelusina—his Isles of Fingal—his Midsummer Night's Perhaps I am unjust in excluding Spontini and Marschner from the rank which their admirers claim for them among the first composers of the day—but I must candidly avow that, though I admit their great endowments, I do not think them worthy of being classed among writers of such superlative genius as Rossini and Auber."", 'M.

However this might be, Rossini received new proofs of admiration from the superintendent of the royal theatres, who, in order -to prevail on him to remain at Naples, constituted him director of the theatres S. Carlo and del Fondo; but Rossini shewed at Naples the same indifference he has since displayed at the Theatre Italien in Paris. In 1817 he gave his Armida, which did not fulfil the expectations of the public; this opera was written in the style of Jomelli, whose “score was probably under his eyes, consequently its success was of a very short duration. But his reputation, already warmly disputed by his adversaries, suffered nothing.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form.

A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

If we were allowed to express a wish, it would be that Mr. Miller should perform on a solid English instrument to which he has been accustomed, and which under his finger would truly express all the delicate degrees of light and shade.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'By consent of the most enlightened of the profession, he has ioug been. placed at the head of the organists of his country, and he has maintained that high character by a uniform display of profound knowledge and reiined taste; in this latter particular Mr. W. has a marked superiority over some of his contemporaries, who enjoy great and well-earned celebrity.
