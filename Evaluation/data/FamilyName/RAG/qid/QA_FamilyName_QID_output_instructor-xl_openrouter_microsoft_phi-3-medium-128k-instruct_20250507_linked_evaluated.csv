What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'T transcribe these pretty words, because it is remarkable that they were written to the music, which was a minuet already published by Rameau amongst his harpsichord music. This air is charming, and perfectly in place: it has but one faultnamely, that of being much too high for the voice of the singer for whom it was written ; at the same time, it would be too low if it were transposed. We see that a hundred years since, as in our own times, (but, perhaps, rather less frequently) poets were cbliged to submit the rhythm of their words to the will of the musician, \x0c It would be troublesome to our readers to continue an examination of operas which are perfectly unknown to them. It will be sufficient to give a list of the dramatic works of Rameau; he bronght out successfully, Les Talens Lyriques, 1739; Dardanus,1739 ; Les Fétes de Polymnie,1745 ; LaPrincesse de Navarre, 1745; Le Temple de la Gloire, 1745; Les Fétes de VHymen, et del Amour, 1747 ; Zais, 1748 ; Pygmalion, 1748 ; [lais,1749 ; Plateé, 1749 ; Zeroastre, 1749 ; Acanthe et Céphise, 1751; La Guirlande\\751 ; Daphnis et Eglé,\\753; Lysis et Délié, 1753; La Natesanec d’ Osiris, 1754; Anacréon, 1754; Zephire, 1754; Néleé et Mirthis, 1754; lo, 1754; Le retour d’Astreé, 1757; Les surprises, de ? Amour, 1759; Les Sybarites, 1759 ; and Les Paladins,1760. Although most of these pieces are in one act, and of trifling importance, the number must seem prodigious, when we consider that Rameau did not commence his dramatic career until he was 50 years old. Hewas 77 when he composed his last opera, and at his death, which took place four years after, in 1764, three manuscript scores were found ready for representation. Rameau’s scores have only been engraved with a pianoforte arrangement, including some particular orchestral effects here and there.', 'One of the principal pieces in Hippolyte et Arcie, is the trio of the Fates, one of the most beautiful compositions of Rameau. It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau. The second work It may be remarked as a singular thing, that the first opera played in France was composed and performed by churchmen; the words were by the Abbé Perrin, the music by Lambert, the organist of Saint Honoré, and all the singers were chosen from the various parishes. Until the establishment of the Conservatoire, during the revolution, there was no other singing school in France than those in the cathedrals, in which sacred buildings the theatrical rehearsals always took place.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires.

Yet there was. no doubt in the minds of our forefathers, nor is there much in our own, that the solid acquisition of an expressive style is likely to be furthered essentially by the knowledge and practice of such studies. And this for the simplest reason in the world—because while they embrace the difficulties, they also depend upon the expressive power of the art.

He was an exquisite violinist, an excellent master, and an original composer. In every thing he undertook to perfect, he left the marks ofan inventive imagination, and a reflective mind. By enlarging the strings of the violin, which till then had been thin and weak, and: by lengthening the bow, he softened its tone, which is naturally harsh, and by improving the position of the bow, by hastening or slackening its motion, and by regulating the pressure, he succeeded in producing a peculiarly sweet and fine tone. His compositions are distinguished by that purity and unity of thought, that exquisite simplicity,.that soft anddelicate pathos, so delightful to persons of feeling, yet so difficult to describe. He was a strong example of the truth of this precept of Horace : “ Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem.,’ His natural modesty at first retarded him in his career, only that he might afterwards raise himself the more rapidly to that pitch of exquisite expression which characterizes his compositions, and which is compared by some to the muse of Petrarch, of whose poetry Tartini was a great admirer. Hence we may believe the assertion, that it was his custom, before he began to compose, to read and meditate upon some one of the sonnets of that poet, in order to illumine his imagination with the pure flame of his Platonic and sublime passion.* ‘There are some who accuse him of being too sparing in his accompaniments, and certainly if his compositions are compared with others, the difference in this respect is but too visible ; but this defect-soon disappears, when we reflect that the delicate colouring of the style of Tartini would.', 'possesses distinguished manners.

He afterwards received further instructions from Saratelli, the predecessor of Galuppi;, as Chapel Master of St. Mark at Venice. In 1771, Lucchesi went with acompany of opera singers _to Bonn, and entered the service of the Elector of Cologne as Chapel Master, with a salary of 1000 florins.. He excelled greatly as a performer on the organ, which instrument he had studied much in Italy. In composition his manner was light, animated, and agreeable, whilst the perfect purity of his style was very remarkable. In his church music he. was however scrupulously exact as torhythm.

Yet there was. no doubt in the minds of our forefathers, nor is there much in our own, that the solid acquisition of an expressive style is likely to be furthered essentially by the knowledge and practice of such studies. And this for the simplest reason in the world—because while they embrace the difficulties, they also depend upon the expressive power of the art. These duets of one of the most able of our modern masters are in the same style, but have little to mark them as the work ofa modern composer.. The characteristics are the same in each moy ement, namely, in the answers and imitations between the parts, and in the modulations and frequent use of chromatics. The melodies are generally of a grave and sedate character, and those in the triple time frequently elegant. - The slow movements are perhaps the best, and these have frequently much tenderness and pathos. We may name the first and eighth as instances. The ninth is a very happy adaptation of the words, but requiring . great delicacy of execution. Indeed the duets are not easy.', 'i it Canto, Arietta, composed by Perrucchint, Il Desideri io, composed by Perrucchini. | La dolce Rimembransa, Arietta, composed bi y Peir, rucchint.']",Metastasio,Q29473,person,Q99910288,Q99910288,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Her reception in Norma, the first opera in which she played this year, was most triumphant. The Celtic priestess is peculiarly her own—an exhibition of energetic passion, which, on the Italian stage, we should in vain look for elsewhere. Why should we dwell on Lablache and Persiani? Who is not so familiar with the prince of basses and of vis comica, with the most delicate and florid of sopranos, as to render all comment on them totally unnecessary ?

This however was not Albinoni’s only, nor perhaps his greatest recommendation to public favour. He was one of the finest violinists of his time, and also held a very high rank as a singer, but in the present instance we must speak of him vonly as a composer. The peculiar character of Albinoni’s style fitted him more for the composition of sacred than of dramatic music; it was distinguished by a certain coldness and rigidity, but ill-suited to the warmth and vigour of scenic effect—yet, by one of those strange contradictions, not less frequent among artists than amongst less enlightened men, he preferred that career, in which he was the least likely to shine—nevertheless his operas, redeemed by the purity and science they displayed, almost all succeeded.', 'Fabio Constantini flourished about the year 1630, and ultimately became maestro at the chapel of Loretto.

Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors.

Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class.

When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau.

The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'Hippolyte “et Arcie (such was the title of Rameau’s first work) was brought out on the Ist of October, 1783.

Perhaps immediately after Mendelssohn, Spohr may take his place as a living composer—though great mannerism and repeated imitations of himself, almost unfit him for a station among such a glorious company.

They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings.

A light style of music may appeal to the heart more effectually, more readily, and more generally than a sounder style, but its effects are fruitless ; the heart is no better for-such an appeal, and soon relinquishes one trivial novelty for another, as children fly from toy to toy ; but intellectual music is ofanother character.

Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually.

This composer studied at Naples under Sacchini, and, after quitting his instructor, travelled through Italy, Germany, and France, in all of which countries his operas were known. and admired, after the year 177 1. Gazzaniga possessed exquisite taste, fine imagina~ tion, and great fertility—besides which his works were characterised by a purity of style which rendered them still more worthy the notice of connoisseurs, and which proves that he copied (as _has been asserted)-the manner of his inimitable master.', 'Bernado Sabadini flourished at the same time with the last. mentionedjcomposer. He became ultimately Chapel Master to the Duke of Parma, and filled the same office at the cathedral of the same town. ‘The operas which gained him the greatest credit, for taste and elegance of style, were “ Il favore degli dei,” “La Gloria degli amori,” “ Eraelea.”’ Sabadini also composed oratorios, the best of which was “ La Divina Sapienza.” Tomaso Albinoni flourished in 1694, and from that time to 1730 he enjoyed very distinguished success, both as a sacred and dramatic composer. This however was not Albinoni’s only, nor perhaps his greatest recommendation to public favour. He was one of the finest violinists of his time, and also held a very high rank as a singer, but in the present instance we must speak of him vonly as a composer. The peculiar character of Albinoni’s style fitted him more for the composition of sacred than of dramatic music; it was distinguished by a certain coldness and rigidity, but ill-suited to the warmth and vigour of scenic effect—yet, by one of those strange contradictions, not less frequent among artists than amongst less enlightened men, he preferred that career, in which he was the least likely to shine—nevertheless his operas, redeemed by the purity and science they displayed, almost all succeeded.']",Grazioli,Q1525873,person,Q37319196,Q37319196,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Something indeed there is much deeper than this—something which no man better than Wagner knows must make its way.; but the process will be slowat least in England—for art must cease to be fashionable before its real value can be gauged, and Opera in this country has not yet become National. The truth cannot be disguised that the Teutonic element in the house had a marvellous effect in teaching the audience that “‘ Lohengrin ” was not to be judged by the ordinary standard; so when the usual round of applause was given for the favourite singers on their entrance and the boisterous marks of approbation burst forth after an effective morceau, a very decided “‘ hush ” convinced the astonished Opera habitués that the vocalists must be considered as secondary to the work they were interpreting, and that any congratulations to individual performers must be reserved for the fall of the curtain. Thus far then has Wagner influenced us for good; and whatever may be the ultimate fate of his works in England, there can be little doubt of the truth of his conviction that the composer has a higher mission than that of administering to the frivolous taste of a frivolous audience. “Lohengrin? must not be accepted as the latest emThere may beand probably is—as much difference between ‘‘ Lohengrin ” and the ‘“* Ring des Niebeliingen ” (which has not yet been heard), as there is between ‘Der Fliegende Hollander ” and Lohengrin.” Wagner’s books must be consulted by all who wish to trace the growth of the idea which has ruled his artistic life; but the result of his philosophy may be found in his Operas, and so progressively developed as to convince even those who disagree with him of the singleness of purpose with which he has worked. Some feeling of disappointment may be widely felt when we are told that the “‘ art work of the future’ is to be based upon mythical legends, and that consequently ‘ Lohengrin” ‘*the type of the sole, real classical subject,” and Elsa, ‘‘woman—woman, as not previously understood,” should be characters which never could have had any real existence; but those who would judge Wagner are bound to come into court with an unbiassed mind; and when we say that for five and twenty years the Opera now submitted to our notice has been gradually rising in public estimation; that it has been played to enthusiastic audiences not only in Germany, but at Bologna, Florence and in the United States, there can be little doubt that it contains within it an element of vitality which cannot fail to preserve it even in the most uncongenial atmosphere.', 'At length Herr Wagner has been fairly placed on his trialin this country. Fairly, we say, because he has had the advantage of a stage and its accessories, but German disciples of the composer will scarcely perhaps admit that such chorus singing as was heard at the Royal Italian Opera on the production of ‘‘ Lohengrin ” on the 8th ult., can convey anything but a faint impression of that poetical feeling which, according to Wagner, should pervade every portion of a work designed for the lyrical stage. It is late now to discuss the theory so ably put forth by this composer, but something may be said of the effect of this theory when, for the first time, we see and hear it in action.', 'In 1751 Metastasio wrote ‘Gluck has surprising fire; but he is mad. He composed an Opera for Venice, which was very unfortunate. He composed others with various success, I am not a man to pretend to judge him.” Strange indeed that so great a genius should be pronounced mad by the very person who acknowledges his incapacity to estimate his powers; and stranger still it will be if, in the course of time, the world should know more of Gluck than of Metastasio. No doubt Wagner has set us thinking; and one of our first thoughts will be to examine critically the works of one of whom Wagner is but the echo; a champion indeed who fought single handed against Italian Opera in Paris, and initiated a theory which, whether fully or partially acted upon in the future, can never die out. ‘Iphigenia in Aulis” was produced in the French capital at a period when success could scarcely be hoped for; and yet it made an impression which, in spite of powerful opposition, was not to be effaced. Now that this work (as well as the later one, “Iphigenia in Tauris,”) is placed before usin a compact and cheap form, it is sincerely to be hoped, even if our lyrical establishments are closed against Gluck, that students will make themselves acquainted with such an inestimable mine of wealth; for in this edition not only is the music carefully supervised, but the indications of instrumentation are so profuse that we seem almost to be reading the score.']",Wagner,Q1511,person,Q2539239,Q2539239,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Moscheles must describe the revels :—‘‘ The proceedings were opened wifh a capital comic scene between two ladies’ maids, acted, in the Frankfort dialect, by Cécile (Madame Mendelssohn) andher sister. Then came a Charade on the word ‘ Gewandhaus,’ Joachim, adorned with a fantastic wig, @ la Paganini, played a hare-brained Impromptu on the G string. The syllable ‘wand’. was represented by the Pyramus and Thisbe wall-scene from the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ;’ for ‘haus’ Charlotte (Mrs. Moscheles) acted a scene she had written herself, in which she is discovered knitting a blue stocking, and soliloquizing on the foibles of female authoresses, advising them to attend to their domestic duties.', 'Mendelssohn invented a game on the pianoforte, and the two used to play it in a manner thus described :-— ‘* We often extemporise together, each of us trying to dart quick as lightning on the suggestions implied by each other’s harmonies, and to construct others upon them. Then Felix, whenever I introduce any motive out of his own works, breaks in and cuts me short by playing a subject from one of my compositions, on which I retort, and then he, and so on, ad infinitum.

Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm. Cramer as leader of the Opera band, an office that he did not long retain, for in 1798 the susceptible feelings of this admirable artist were destined to expede piano, a work in which she progressively conducts her pupils from the simplest to the greatest difficulties, is well known to the public.']",Tartini,Q108555,person,Q99911979,Q99911979,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

I cannot thank you sufficiently for this splendid testimonial which you and other friends have just presented to me under this hospitable roof by the hands of Lord Dudley. I wish I', 'not to be denied, but we doubt his inferences in their extent. It appears to us that the immediate momentum of the Abbey meetings had passed away, and that the triennial meetings occasioned no more sensation than any. other local festival ; nay, in point of fact, they created less, perhaps, from the circumstance of the frequency.. Birmingham, we must think, aroused: the kingdom by the magnitude of the receipts, and by the excellence and extent of the arrangements, and seized the first leading advantage of “ the wide spreading cultivation of music.””. And this we conceive to be the peculiar praise of Mr. Moore and the committee and conductors of those far-famed meetings.. But let us not lead the reader to suppose that Mr. Crosse has attempted to weaken the claims of Birmingham ; on the contrary, he has concluded this division of his subject with an eulogy so nearly in accordance with our own words, that but for the necessity of our own explanation, we should rather have substituted his, and we even now superadd a few of his concluding sentences: a nn “To the sound judgment which planned the triennial recur-— rence of the Birmingham meetings, we have. just ventured chiefly to ascribe the foundation of their fame; and to the unwearied assiduity and steady perseverance which fostered their early growth, the preceding pages have borne testimony, so far as the materials were within our reach, as well as to the zeal, the energy, and the taste that have directed their more recent celebrations. Let us here cheerfully add, that the example which they have afforded, though it be not granted to be the oldest in point of time, or the greatest with respect to pecuniary results, can. yet unquestionably claim the higher and less adventitious distinction of being the best on record, and of having, more than any other, imparted a beneficial influence to the art of music, and given an accelerated impulse _to its application in behalf of charitable purposes. To the festivals of Gloucester, therefore, of Birmingham, and of York—to each and every institution, individually established with the same noble object, every lover of harmony, and every friend of humanity will, we are assured cordially unite with us in saying, Esto per— petua.”” ° os oo Oo Mr. Crosse deserves the praise of declining no labour in the illustration of this portion of his subject, and if there appeay to be considerable districts of which no notice is to be found, yet where we believe music has flourished, it is we are confident to be attributed to the extreme difficulty that attends obtaining communications upon such subjects. We are far more surprised with the extent of the information afforded us than with any such omis\x0c YORK FESTIVAL. - . 427 sions, for it is the reproach of professional men that they too much disregard literary enquiry. Upon this point no one can be better entitled to speak than the writer of this article, and most earnest have been his endeavours to awaken musicians to the weight which the cultivation of letters would addto their individual consequence, ‘as well as to the character of their art. Nor has any circum_ stance since the establishment of the Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review offered so gratifying a reward as well as testimony of the efficacy of the exertions which have been-bestowed upon this Journal, as the notice and use of their contents by Mr. Crosse, in ‘a book which will assuredly find a place among the permanent musical records of the country.

His compositions are very good, and are formed after the models of Palestrina and his immediate successors. Constantini, who stood high in character both as a.musician and a man, was a stranger to dissi\x0c SCHOOLS: OF ROME AND BOLOGNA. | 915 mulation and envy: he worked for the good of his art ‘and his: country, and besides his own writings, he made a selection of all those of the most celebrated of his cotemporaries and predecessors, entitled “Cantiones exceilentissimorum auctorum octonis vocibus concinende, a Fabio Constantino, Rom. Urb. Cathedralis Musice prefecto in lucem edite.” Philippo Nicoletti, who flourished at the sane time with the last-mentioned composer, published several madrigals, which were much admired by his ceuntrymen; also a great deal of church music, and he became chapel-master to one of the cathedrals of Rome.. | The next composer who claims our attention was one w ho con‘tributed greatly towards the. improvement of madrigals, a species of composition at that time much wanting the hand ofa skilful musician to carry it to perfection. Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', 'Bernado Sabadini flourished at the same time with the last. mentionedjcomposer. He became ultimately Chapel Master to the Duke of Parma, and filled the same office at the cathedral of the same town. ‘The operas which gained him the greatest credit, for taste and elegance of style, were “ Il favore degli dei,” “La Gloria degli amori,” “ Eraelea.”’ Sabadini also composed oratorios, the best of which was “ La Divina Sapienza.” Tomaso Albinoni flourished in 1694, and from that time to 1730 he enjoyed very distinguished success, both as a sacred and dramatic composer. This however was not Albinoni’s only, nor perhaps his greatest recommendation to public favour. He was one of the finest violinists of his time, and also held a very high rank as a singer, but in the present instance we must speak of him vonly as a composer. The peculiar character of Albinoni’s style fitted him more for the composition of sacred than of dramatic music; it was distinguished by a certain coldness and rigidity, but ill-suited to the warmth and vigour of scenic effect—yet, by one of those strange contradictions, not less frequent among artists than amongst less enlightened men, he preferred that career, in which he was the least likely to shine—nevertheless his operas, redeemed by the purity and science they displayed, almost all succeeded.', 'and brilliancy of imagination which always rendered his music attractive, and were: sufficient recommendations to raise it to a_ high rank in modern composition. Throughout his works however there was such great want of purity and correctncss of style as to be.a constant drawback on the pleasure derived from hearing them, besides considerably decreasing their value-in the esti- mation of connoisseurs. The following is a list of. his operas :- “& Pandolfo.” 1745; “ La Fata maravigliosa,” 1746 ; Olimpiade,” 1747; Il vello d’oro,”’ 1749; “ Chi tutto abbraccia, nulla stringe,” 1753; “ La Cascina and Statira,” 1756 ; “ La Conversazione, Artaserse, and Alessandro nell’ Indie,” 1758; “ Il Ciarlatano,” 1759; “ La. buona Figluola maritata,”’ 1762: “ Donna stravagante and Schiava riconosciuta,” 1766. Andrea Lucchesi was born at Malta, in the Venetian States, in 1741. He however. received his first: instructions. in music at Naples, where he studied sacred composition under 11 Padre Poalucci, the scholar of the Padre Martini, and dramatic under Cochi. He afterwards received further instructions from Saratelli, the predecessor of Galuppi;, as Chapel Master of St. Mark at Venice. In 1771, Lucchesi went with acompany of opera singers _to Bonn, and entered the service of the Elector of Cologne as Chapel Master, with a salary of 1000 florins.. He excelled greatly as a performer on the organ, which instrument he had studied much in Italy. In composition his manner was light, animated, and agreeable, whilst the perfect purity of his style was very remarkable. In his church music he. was however scrupulously exact as torhythm. His operas are “ L’Isola della Fortuna,” at’ Venice, 1765; Jl Marito geloso, at Venice, and “ Le Donne sempre donne,” 1766; “Jl Matrimonio per astusia,’ A771; “Il Giocatore amoroso,” an interlude for two persons.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered.

Colbran and Dardanelli, the celebrated tenor David, and the peculiar baritone Nozzari.* The Neapolitans recognized in Rossini the mah who was soon to be captivated by their beautiful country ; in fact if Venus (as Schubart said of Naumann) had wished for a chapel master, her choice would infallibly have fallen upon Rossini; such charms do his melodies possess. Thus he has received proofs of the highest favour of the Neapolitan public.

He received his first lessons in music from his parents, who were distinguished amateurs; but soon the art which they had intended as a mere diversion for him became his reigning passion. In vain did his father wish him to take degrees at the college. of Dijon; thanks to his mania for music, with which he tormented the professors and his fellow students, he was expelled from college, and gave himself up with ardour to the study of the harpsichord, the organ, and violin, searching every where to obtain lessons in composition, but finding no one capable of giving him assistance.', 'One of the principal pieces in Hippolyte et Arcie, is the trio of the Fates, one of the most beautiful compositions of Rameau. It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses.

Metastasio, however, always abiding by the strictest rules of honour and probity, declined in toto this generous gift, which he transferred altogether to her husband, and this sacrifice, for great sacrifice it was, must be considered highly honourable to the poet's heart. As to the exact nature of the connexion subsisting between him and Romanini, it must for ever remain a conjecture, and a mere conjecture—whether it was Platonic, or of a tenderer kind, who can pretend to determine? Metastasio, it is true, lived under the same roof with her, both at Rome and Naples, but so did her husband ; and the very kind and familiar manner in. which the poet writes to the husband, expressing his friendship for the wife, to the wife of his kindliness to the husband, and the sincerity with which he expressed to him his condolence and. affliction for ‘her death, would, in any other country but Italy, be thought sufficiently indicative of conjugal happiness. But there, Dr. Burney observes, the female singers generally find it convenient to have a nominal husband, who will fight their battles, and contend with the impresario or manager. And we shall not perhaps be judging too uucharitably of the Romanini, should we incline to the belief that her affection for Metastasio had more in it of the love of woman, than of Platonic attachment.

A melodious subject for the ‘‘ Pleni sunt cceli’ with an elegant triplet accompaniment for the violins succeeds, and leads with a half cadence on the dominant seventh to the ‘‘ Osanna.” This movement is not, as is generally the case, treated fugally ; with the exception of the ‘‘Cum sancto spiritu,” already noticed, there is no attempt at a fugue throughout the Mass. The present is a bright little chorus in eight parts, short exclamations of the word “ Osanna’ by divided trebles and altos being answered by similarly divided tenors and basses. The “ Benedictus” for soprano, alto, and tenor solos with chorus is a good specimen of a portion of the Mass in which Schubert was invariably successful. It is full of charming and flowing melody, and is certainly one of the best movements in the work. The “ Agnus Dei” is also of much excellence; the modulation at the bottom of p. 88 of the score, and the beautiful treatment of the word “ Miserere,” should be especially noticed. The Dona,” on the other hand, though exceedingly pretty, is in no way great music; itis remarkable for the simplicity of its construction, the voices moving together in plain chords, without the least attempt at counterpoint throughout.', 'Graxp Cuorvu s—“ Gloria in excelsis.”— Haydn.']",Mozart,Q254,person,Q18574758,Q18574758,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

But the operas to which these overtures are merely preludes remain unknown. And yet,they have been warmly and repeatedly eulogized by authorities looked upon with excellent reason as. trustworthy. While citing Beethoven, indeed, a contemporary might have adduced Béethoven’s own words in the famous letter about the Secend Mass—the fact of which having called forth no acknowledement from Cherubini was inexplicable, until accounted for by the other fact of its never having reached Cherubini’s hands. For though, as Mendelssohn tells us, the composer of Afedea said of Beethoven's later music: “Ca me fait éternucr,”’ he entertained'a genuine respect for the earlier and middle productions of that magnificent genius. The rest were perhaps not exactly in his sphere. But apart from Beethoven and other distinguished Germans, there are those at home, on whose opinions sufficient reliance might have, been placed, to justify long since a trial of one of tha,one-° ras of Cherubini, either in Italian or English. he time is come at last, however, and the result surpasses what could, under any ordinary circumstances, have been expected.

Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually. I-esteem such a circumstance to be rather honourable in the comparison I have endeavoured to maintain, because even under the most unfavourable influence, English genius developed and manifested its powers. Nothing can more clearly demonstrate my position than the history of Arne, given in the Review to which [have just referred.

The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice?

In the first place, I think, if such a thing were effected it would be very monotonous and uninteresting, and, in the next, I think, there are very few men in England capable of such an effort, and those few who are capable would not think it worth the trouble, having higher notions of music than such mechanical drudgery, Let a fugue by all means be the test, but a fugue according to the fancy of the writer; and even then the society would not be overburdened with members, for 1 positively think there is not a composer living, (I do not except even Mr. Flowers, who appears, in his wish to separate himseif from “ the chaff,” to entertain so exalted an opinion of his own merits) who can explain what the precise nature of a fngue may happento be. Cherubini, in his “‘ Counterpoint,”’ lays down a mass of rules and breaks them every one in his examples—or, if not Cherubini, Halévy for him, who is said to have written the book. (What a profound imposition by the way, of both the French and English publishers to father the work of so uninformed a musician as Halévy on a man like Cherubini, and sell it to the public as the offspring of the latter illustrious composer: ). I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning.

But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull.

Nothing, in truth, but the most stupid ignorance or the blackest malignity lll ‘could assert of such a country of artists, that “ the decline of music in Italy is complete.” ’ M. Fetis has well answered the aitack, and shown that the critic who can place Bellini, Mercadante, &c., by the side of Rossini—who can put Pasta on a level with Tosi, must be wholly incapable of discussing a question which requires some knowledge of music, and some power of judging between good and bad performers.

In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull.

Gavinies, so long in vogue. This romance he performed at the age of 63, with such exquisite expression as to draw tears from a crowded audience at a public concert. Gavinies published three books of sonatas, and several concertos, which are very highly esteemed by connoisseurs. A year before his death (in 1799) he published a work entitled ‘ Les vingt quatre Matinées,” which contains music of still more difficult execution than the Caprices of Locatelli and Fiorillo. Gavinies was particularly celebrated for his skill in accompaniment, and the taste he display ed in the variations he introduced. ‘-Before entering upon .the histories of the scholars of Gavinies, it t will be right to give some account of his eotemporar ies.', 'In 1790, one of the deputies of the Assemblée Constituante, who had a range of apartments on the fifth floor of a house, prevailed upon Viotti, who was his intimate friend, to give a concert at his chambers. Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm. Cramer as leader of the Opera band, an office that he did not long retain, for in 1798 the susceptible feelings of this admirable artist were destined to expede piano, a work in which she progressively conducts her pupils from the simplest to the greatest difficulties, is well known to the public.']",Gavinies,Q490205,person,,,0,0,0,0,QID,1,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

By the way, I have been told that she is not really blind, and that the bandage over her eyes was placed there by the “old ones,” only because ‘they found themselves unable to account rationally for so many of her whims and caprices.. But for my part, 1 cannot believe this, especially when I consider the extraordinary eminence to which she has raised some men, in spite of their shallow qualifications.

But I have too much sense of propriety to shew my reading by trespassing so much on your valuable space, and therefore I shall content myself with glancing at the musicians; indeed it will be sufficient for my purpose if I select him whose name stands at the head of this letter. How common it is to hear Rossini called “ the child of Fore tune”—the spoiled child, according to some—“ the most lucky fellow” that ever put pen to music paper, and other epithets which shew the sensation produced by his brilliant and extraordinary career. Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'We shall proceed to notice separately the principal features of the compositions enumerated above.

For ten years Jarnowick was in great favour with the public. The charactéristics of his style were purity, precision, and elegance, but he failed in producing a vigorous tone, in sensibility of expression, und above all, in his cadences.

Nimpor’e—we do not carry injuries long in our remembrance; and though neglect is the deepest of injuries, we can even swallow neglect, for the sake of advancing the interests of art. Let us swallow, then, our ill treatment, and proceed, in a few words, to celebrate the merits of Mr. Charles Patey, Professer of the Violin at the Royal Academy of Music.', 'For my own part I must say, I am gratified with the survey, and though nothing will satisfy me while any thing remains to be done, I can but consider that nature has not left us so incapable, as we have been hitherto described, nor have the feeling or industry of Englishmer’ been so little exerted, as our foreign competitors would have it thought. The chief bars to the universality of our composers’ force, have been the language, atid the want of a regular lyric drama. If we could possess ourselves of the last, it might go some way towards removing the impediments which are cast in our path to greatness by the first. : But, Sir, till we have a legitimate opera, till we make music a part of the education of the people, till we have a national school, the understanding and love of the art cannot be expected to per_vade, English society, to form such a part of the national delights, as it does in ‘foreign countries, where, in addition to these means of. propagation, it is a part of the religion of the country, and in hourly exercise. When showever the effects of imusic, thus cultivated and enjoyed, upon the character and happiness of a people are taken into view, it becomes a question worthy the considera- tion of the rich and power ful, whether their chiefest attention and their chiefest patronage and support should be so exclusively . given to the productions and the performance of foreign talent, as they are in the support of the. Italian opera, and in their neglect of our English lyric drama, when our countrymen have given such decided pr oof of genius.', 'About the year 1653, having the reputation of being an admirable composer, he, ‘at the request of great personages,’ says Anthony Wood, ‘composed several sets of ayres of four parts, to be performed by violins and an organ, which being esteemed the best of their kind that could be then composed, were sent as great rarities into Germany, to the . court of Archduke Leopold (afterwards Emperor), and often played by his (the prince’s) own musicians, he himself being a composer, and great admirer of music.’ And here we may remark, en passant, that, less than two cen_turies ago, English music was held in high estimation ia Germany, and there sought after by the cognoscenti: now hardly a page of it is to be met with in the whole of that great, that very musical country, a country on which we depend for almost every work of excellence produced at our concerts, or listened to in our drawing-rooms. It seems to us that it would be no difficult matter to assign satisfactory reasons for this; but to enter into the subject here would be departing from our main purposes, which are chiefly biographical, and, to a certain extent, critical. In 1658, Mr. Rogers was, by a mandate from the pro_ tector Cromwell, admitted to the degree of bachelor in music by the university of Cambridge. At the restoration, the city of London having invited Charles II., and both houses of parliament, to dine at Guildhall, Rogers was employed to write some music for the occasion, which, Wood tells us, ‘being admirably well done, gave great content, and the author being present, obtained a great name for his composition, and a plentiful reward.’ This consisted of a hymn, beginning ‘ Exultate justi in Domino,’ of which ‘those stanzas daily sung by way of grace after meat at Magdalen College, Oxford, are part,’ as we learn from Sir John Hawkins ; but of the rest, we are not enabled to give any account. He soon after became organist of Eton, and afterwards of Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1669, the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of doctor in music, an honour which did not secure him against a change in fortune, for he died in very straitened circumstances in 1698.']",Pauer,Q79183,person,Q37558453,Q37558453,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

He was enabled, in the course of a few years, to return to Dijon, where he was offered the situation of organist; but what he desired was fame, which prompted him to visit Paris. He refused the offer and hastened to the capital; there it was necessary he should live: an organist’s place would furnish him with the means; there was a vacancy at the church of Sazat Paul ; it was to be filled up by election; Rameau was a candidate ; his opponent, Dagnin, was successful; he was obliged to leave Paris; an organist was required for the church of Saint Etienne at Lille, where he also offered himself and was accepted; but he only remained a short time in this town.

The good Abbé had a great esteem for Rameau, and asa composer of church music rendered him full and entire justice ; but, as the author of operas, he had not entirely the same confidence in the organist, he therefore required that Rameau should give him a bill of £500 as a guarantee against the ill success which was likely to attend an unknown, and especially a learned musician, which he had unfortunately the reputation of being. Rameau set to work vigorously, and so soon as his score was completed, it was tried at the, residence of M. de la Popeliniére, fermier gééral, who had declared ‘himself the patron of Rameau, from whom his wife received harpsichord lessons. To the praise of Pelegrine be it said, he was so enchanted by this trial, that he instantly returned Rameau the note for £500, saying that such music required no guarantee.', 'At the next service, instead of the beautiful harmonies to which they were uccustomed, nothing was heard but a confusion of indistinct sounds, in fact, an assemblage of the most discordant notes, and a melange of squeaking and msupportable noises.

At last a great and solemn Jéte was about to be celebrated, at which it was desirable to avoid the public scandal which these musical horrors would necessarily produce. Rameau was sent for by the bishop, who, in spite of all his efforts, could obtain nothing from the restive organist, but on condition that he rescinded his engagement. From that moment Rameau brought into play his wonted skill, and on the /éte day he played with such perfection, that the regret for his loss became more lively than ever, but the contract was annihilated, and the eagle spread his wings to fly and seek the star which was the object of his most ardent desires. Scarcely had Rameau arrived ia Paris (where he soon made himself known, both by his Treatise on Harmony, and his Pieces for the Harpsichord), when he obtained the situation of organist at the church of Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie. He had had some little pieces performed at the Theatre de la foire, but these were not very well received, and he did not gain what his ambition desired ; this was to produce a work for the Academie royale de Musique.']",Rameau,Q1145,person,Q24529820,Q24529820,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Choron has however re-embodied the bulk of his examples in his “ Principes de Composition.” It does. therefore appear that Sala came after Leo, though knowing the careful accuracy of the Editor of the Fitzwilliam Music, we should almost be inelined to Suspeet the sources from which we draw our correction.']",The family name of Leo is not provided in the given context.,Q316735,person,Q6523505,,0,0,0,1,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

The coarseness of her tone and expression, as compared with the commanding brilliancy of Catalani’s voice, the finish of Colbran’s, the beauty of Fodor’s, and the delicacy and clearness of Camporese’s, leaves her, as we esteem the matter, With respect to this quality the book we have so often quoted contains the following very curious anecdote. ‘ On a demandé aux amis de‘Made- moiselle Pasta quel avait été son maitre comme actrice? Elle n’en eut jamais d’autre qu’un coeur propre a sentir vivement les moindres nuances de passion, et une admiration passionnée et allant jusqu’au ridicule pour le beau idéal.

Quand elle a essuyé ses larmes: ‘ Je n’accepte point vos louanges, leur dit-elle. Cet enfant m’a demandé l’auméne-d’une maniére sublime. . J’ai-vu, en un clin d’ceil, tous les malheurs de sa mére, la misére de leur maison, le manque de vétemens, le froid qu’ils souffrent bien des fois. Je ‘serais une. grande actrice si dans occasion je pouvais trouver un geste exprimant le profond malheur avec cette vérité.’ ee oo S¢ Ce sont, je crois, des milliers d’observations de ce genre, dont Mademoi- Selle Pasta avait la conscience dés l’age de six ans, qu’élle se rappelle distinctement, et dont elle se sert 4 la scéne dans le besoin, qui tui valurent'son talent et lui ont servi-de modéle.” oe a a That such are the materials which great actors draw from nature may be corroborated by many instances. We shall relate one of Garrick in confirmation, which was told to the writer of this article by the friend who was with him at the time. Garrick walking with this gentleman through the streets of London, met a butcher’s boy carrying some meat in a tray on his head, and .. whistling as he went for want of thought.’ Garrick sprung upon him, seized him by the collar, and with the most vehement gesticulations exclaimed, “ You villain, have I not told you a thousand times not to do that?” Theboy’s features underwent an immediate change to consternation, and he-stammered out “ Indeed Sir I never saw you before.’ Garrick quitted his hold, said he was mistaken, and passed on. His friend scarcely less astonished than the poor boy, asked what this could possibly mean. ‘¢ Why,” said Garrick, ‘¢ I wished to see the effect of surprize and terror upon simple nature, and I"", 'was decidedly superior to the latter. The great drawback upon her singing was an occasional infirmity in the’ sustaining power, not unlike, though not to the same extent, as the trembling of voice observed in Mademoiselle Bonini. “But she is certainly an artist of the first class, though eclipsed by the forcibly and sublime expression of Pasta, and by the extraordinary facility of Sontag.* Mademoiselle Brambilla has not had much to do, especially during the latter part of the season, after the ‘engagement of Madame Schutz, but-the richness of her voice, her pure manner, and the beauty of her person have won upon her audiences. She has fine natural requisites, and study will probably advance her to eminence in her profession, while extreme youth affords abundant time and opportunity forthe culture of-her ability.

Her personal charms are unimpaired, and her acknowledgements of the enthusiastic reception with which she was greeted, were most graceful. Her vocal powers are certainly changed; her voice is not what it was, but it is still shows the original proportions of nature and art. She sung “ Batti, Batti,” with the same sweetness and delicacy, and ‘* Non temer,” with the same archness as ever, and it seems pro_ bable her voice may be restored by her native climate.', ""Ay monast the chang eS of the time, we have had frequent occasion toremark, that there is none mofesingular orcomplete than the taste for rapid Italian comic compositions. In our characters of Signor and Madame Ronzi de Begnis* we entered somewhat at large into the causes which appear to have produced this predilection, and which reside j in the music itself. But much is attributable. to the merit of those admirable performers who have succeeded each other with such continuous brilliancy of talent, that we should almost be tempted to believe success in this particular depart- ment to be more easy of attainment than in any other. It wifl be understood that while we write, Morelli, Naldi, Ambrogetti, and De Begnis, are within our recollection, as well as those ast most excellent performers. That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull. We shall have occasion further to illustrate this truth i in the progress of our present memoir. But be this as it-may, we are warranted in stating that no other music has made such way in the public esti: mation of late as this of which we are speaking.

He was an exquisite violinist, an excellent master, and an original composer. In every thing he undertook to perfect, he left the marks ofan inventive imagination, and a reflective mind. By enlarging the strings of the violin, which till then had been thin and weak, and: by lengthening the bow, he softened its tone, which is naturally harsh, and by improving the position of the bow, by hastening or slackening its motion, and by regulating the pressure, he succeeded in producing a peculiarly sweet and fine tone. His compositions are distinguished by that purity and unity of thought, that exquisite simplicity,.that soft anddelicate pathos, so delightful to persons of feeling, yet so difficult to describe. He was a strong example of the truth of this precept of Horace : “ Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem.,’ His natural modesty at first retarded him in his career, only that he might afterwards raise himself the more rapidly to that pitch of exquisite expression which characterizes his compositions, and which is compared by some to the muse of Petrarch, of whose poetry Tartini was a great admirer. Hence we may believe the assertion, that it was his custom, before he began to compose, to read and meditate upon some one of the sonnets of that poet, in order to illumine his imagination with the pure flame of his Platonic and sublime passion.* ‘There are some who accuse him of being too sparing in his accompaniments, and certainly if his compositions are compared with others, the difference in this respect is but too visible ; but this defect-soon disappears, when we reflect that the delicate colouring of the style of Tartini would.', ""thus expresses himself, when speaking of the state of music in Italy when Tartini first appeared.

His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7."", 'In this species of writing the severity of criticism is sometimes disarmed in consideration of its great difficulty, but our author has no occasion to beg for much indulgence. By his skill and industry he has atchieved what Mr. Horsley, in his preface to his book of Canons, considers to be of much more consequence than “uncommon contrivance.” He has given to his canon the effect of a free composition.” The subjects are pleasing and characteristic ; the parts sing without any stiffness, and the counterpoint is clear throughout.

Miss Isabel Weale, who has recently come into somewhat prominent notice in connection wi Mr. Barnby’s daily concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, sang iause for herrendering of the soprano air, “O that thou hearkened,” and her singing of “With verdure clad,’ in the second part, called forth a twice ated encore. In the contralto solo, “Love not the world,’ Miss Marion Severn was also hi successful. But the chief burden of the solo portion of the work falls upon the tenor and baritone. . whose reputation is increasing steadily and surely, sang the tenor airs with a skill and feeling which left nothing to be desired, and, especially in the one beginning “ How many hired servants of my father’s,” deeply impressed the audience. Mr. Bridge’s excellent baritone voice was shown te advantage in the airs, “ Trust in the Lord” and “For this my son.” The duets for tenor and bass, “ Father, I have sinned ’’ and. ‘‘ My son is yet alive,” and the quartet, “ The Lord is nigh,” were most effective, and elicited much a plause. The two principal choruses, ‘O that men wo praise the Lord” and “Thou, O Lord, art our Father,” were sung with vigour and precision, and also the chert &ccompanying the tenor air, “ Let us eat and drink.” The secon pat ‘was very brief, and consisted of a few sacred airs and anthems. A recitative and air, “The soft southern breeze,” from Barnby’s “ Rebekah,” was exquisitely sung by Mr. Stedman, and Mr. Vernon Linley gave “Is not His word like a fire,” from “Elijah,” and Gounod’s “ Nazareth,” with a power which time and experience will farther develop.', ""fugued choruses, “‘ In the voice of praise ” and “ Put thy trust in God.” 7. ‘* My song shall be alway.”—This is the first of the four-part anthems, containing, in the choruses, two tenor parts instead of one. The first tenor part in all these later anthems lies high, and rather corresponds to a male alto part than to an ordinary tenor; indeed, in some cases, Handel has written the part in the alto clef. In the present work, more than in any other of these anthems, the composer used old material. The subject of the opening symphony is borrowed from the Ode for Queen Anne's Birthday, and the movement in the form in which we find it here is identical with the first movement of the third oboe concerto. The. commencement of the first chorus is taken from the Passion of Christ, and the phrase, ‘‘The heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works,” is nothing more than “the heavens and all the powers therein,” of the Utrecht “Te Deum.” The subject of the last chorus is also taken from the same work. The finest part of this anthem is the choral writing.

W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'I yield, however, completely and unreservedly to the Italians during this period, and I refer those of your readers who may wish to examine a little. further into causes, to the Review of Mr. Bishop’s Operas, at page 198 of your First Volume, where the facts are stated and discussed at some length. Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually. I-esteem such a circumstance to be rather honourable in the comparison I have endeavoured to maintain, because even under the most unfavourable influence, English genius developed and manifested its powers. Nothing can more clearly demonstrate my position than the history of Arne, given in the Review to which [have just referred. From this period to the present day J encounter the giants of the Italian theatre. Piccini, Pergolesi, Sarti, Sacchini, Paisiello, and Cimarosa, to mention none of the ‘yest, now flourished.

From the oratorios of Handel himself, many such instances might be adduced, but we content ourselves with referring only to a point or two in Judas Maccabeus. For instance, the eherusses ‘Hear us, lerd.’ and the final Hallelujah,’ are unquestionably church music ; but the song “ Sound an alarm.” and the sub:equent chorus ‘* We hear.” cannot be so termed they are simply dramatic compocitiens of the very highest order. {Indecd. in the celebrzted march in this oratorio Hendel appears to be The whole structure of striving to forego his innately ponderous stsle ' in favour of one more suited to the dramatic ne- | For the Introduction we cannot say much ; cessity of the occasion. In Beethoven’s Mount of Olives we find the same principle even more pointedly exemp ified. In one piece the cuntrast of the simple dramatic with the purely ecclesiastical style is remarkable. We refer to the opening aria for the tenor. So long as the text speaks only of the physical sufferings of the Saviour in his character of man, the music is merely, but intensely, dramatic; but the instant supplication becomes the poet’s theme—at the words “Father, lowly bends before thee’’the first character of the music is. changed fer one purely devotional. Again, in the same oratorio, we instantly recognise in the grand recitative of the angels, “ ‘Thus wills Jehovah,” all that sublimity of character which we habitually attribute to church music ; but the trio, “ My soul with rage and fury,”’ and the chorus of soldiers, ‘‘iie came towards this mountuin,” partake nothing of this character. They are grand, impressive, and truthfully dramatic, if you will; but they have not the remotest reference to the metaphysical or the divine. We take no note of masses, anthems, and the like, since they are intended for the service of the church, and there."", 'The pieces are a quartet and chorus from Haydn, a base solo and quartet from Himmel, a trio from Cherubini, a duet for tenor _..and base from a MS. of Naumann, a quartet from the Benedictus of Huminel’s first mass, a quartet and chorus of Andreas Romberg, a quartet, from a rare MS. of Bonelli, and a Tantum ergo and chorus by Mr: Novello. The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book.

Before I enter into. a brief detail of the beauties and defects of this symphony, it may be\x0c BEETHOVEN\'S NEW SYMPHONY. | Sl right at once to say, that its length alone will be a never-failing cause of complaint to those who reject monopoly in sounds, as it takes up exactly one hour and twenty minutes in performance, which is not compensated by any beauty or unity of design, taking the composition as a whole. ‘There are four different movements. The first is in — non troppo eun poco allegro,” in time, and the first thirteen bars display the well-known eccentricity of this composer, for the basses and horns remain on the two notes, E-A, during those bars, and form apparently” a subject to work upon—but, like the Aurora. Borealis, no sooner do you feast your eyes on the phe. nomenon, than in an instant it vanishes from your sight. The latter part of this movement ts masterly and full of ability. The second movement is in D minor, 3 time, ** Molto Vivace;” the style lively and brilliant, but I was not pleased sufficiently with the design of it to retain more than the first few bars. The third movement, an “ Adagio con moto e cantabile,” in common time, is in my opinion decidedly the best and most pleasing part of the symphony ; it flows in a melodious style of plain but excellent harmony, in simple counterpoint, of many real parts—and although I could discover nothing particularly novel in the melodies thus interwoven, yet they were elegant, and moved in “ liquid sweetness” to the end of the adagio. The fourth and last movement, upon which the violent admirers of Beethoven seem to place all their ill-judged vehemence of approbation, is one of the most extraordinary instances I have ever witnessed, of great powers of mind and wonderful science, wasted upon subjects infinitely beneath its strength. But I must at the same time declare, that parts of this movement, one especially where the bases lead off a sort of fugal subject of about twenty bars, in a bold and com-manding style, afterwards answered by the other parts, are really beautiful, and would be sufficient to have raised fame for any composer less known—but even here, while we are enjoying the delight of so much science and melody, and eagerly anticipating its continuance, on a sudden, like the fleeting pleasures of life, or the spirited young adventurer, who would fly from ease and comfort at home, to the inhospitable shores of New Zealand or Lake Ontario, we are snatched away from such eloquent music, to crude, wild, and extraneous harmonies, that may to some ears ex-~ VOL.

Explanation: The person in the given sentence is simply referred to as ""Beethoven,"" with no additional title or formal name that indicates a family name. As such, the given answer here is taken to represent the family name ""Beethoven,"" which is exceptional as it is quite uncommon for a surname to also serve as the full name for someone, making Beethoven quite a unique case. Generally, a surname or family name is distinct from a given name and is typically used in formal contexts or when full names are needed for clarity; in this case, 'Beethoven' is used as both, perhaps due to the cult status of the individual, making it a proper name.

This answer was arrived at using the content context provided which includes multiple references to the individual, instead of directly from a structured sentence where ""family name"" is explicitly mentioned.",Q255,person,Q42864897,,0,0,0,1,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art! Grazioli (who must not be confounded with the composer of the same name, who died at Venice in 1820) .', 'sea-side to correct the impediment in his speech by the noise of the waves, they exercised their scholars by making them sing opposite to the stone, which, by distinctly repeating the sounds, warned them of their defects, and they were thus enabled to: correct. their errors with greater ease. Francesco Brivio, in Milan, and Francesco Redi, in Florence, were celebrated musicians, but the latter must not be confounded with Francesco Redi, who so materially improved the language, poetry, and natural philosophy of his country. The most celebrated schools of song however were Naples and Bologna; the former, so renowned in the annals of modern music, includes so great a number of schools and masters, that it would occupy too much time-to enumerate them. The most eminent were those of Leonardo Leo, Domenico Egizio, Francesco Feo,* Alessandro ‘Scarlatti, and Nicolo Porpora ;t under the instructions of these masters, great, not only in the practice of their art, but also in their manner of teaching it; were formed numerous musicians, who gained the admiration of all Europe.

That such a conjecture may be founded in truth is not only supported by the fact of the rich succession. of singers we have alluded to, but by the consideration, that we often perceive not much more than a moderately good voice, a power of rapid utterance, anda quick ear, to be the qualities and attainments of singers of this class. They. speak indeed quite as much as they sing, and are indebted for the approbation that follows them, as much to humour as to science.— Ambrogettit could not sing at all, and even De Begnis, when he attempts any thing serious, is not eminently successfull.

Complaints, on this head, have been made at all times: more than a century ago, Bedford, in his work entitled “The Great Abuse of Musick,” thus expresses himself :—“ It is. lamentable to consider, that when _aman comes to church for the good of his soul, in hopes that every thing there shall.inerease his devotion, the musick serves only to increase his distraction ; and he can scarcely ever hear any thing from the finger of the organist, which tends to gravity and . sobriety ; but a wanton light air, as if designed to spoil the endeavours of the minister in all the offices of our excellent church, and banish from the house of God ev ery serious thought.” This is the language ofan intrepid assailant of the “light and wanton” style of church playing which prevailed in his day, and, a — Jittle further on, he says— If any one complains of this abuse to the parishioners, their answer is, that they do not understand it, (and who does, as it is now managed 7) I know not any sober person, who can ‘understand any thing in it, except a jargon of confusion, without head or tail, including all the keys of the gamut in a promiscuous manner, without any cadence or_connexion, intermixed sometimes, with a wanton airy fancy, and at others with a heavy sordid performance, and all this. occasioned by extempore maggots in all the voluntaries and interludes, whilst the man is conceited of his own parts, because no one else understands what he would be at, and. scorns to practice such things as are tried and approved of by the best masters.”” The italics, and __the punctuation, will shew, that I have transcribed honest Arthur nost literally.', 'degrees, compose the principal merit of this singer, and render: him as it were the soul of the choir, the glory of which consists in a perfect traditionary style.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", ""Mr. Neate played with great ability.

Such a career is indeed remarkable, and Fortune may have had some hand init; but, as I owe little to the old lady myself, I am not willing that she should enjoy more credit than falls to her share: in consequence of this, I shall endeavour to assign some reasons for the success ofthe “ Gran Maestro.” How stand the facts with regard to him? Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

Next come five series of orchestral music, including 41 symphonies, 31 divertimenti and serenades, 21 marches and small orchestral movements, 25 sets of dances, and 21 concertos for a stringed or wind instrument, with orchestral. accompaniment. We then have three series of chamber compositions—g stringed quintetts, 31 stringed quartetts, 3 duets, and 1 trio. The pianoforte works occupy seven more series, divided as follows : 28 concertos, II quintetts, quartetts, and trios, 43 sonatas and two sets of variations for piano and violin, 8 pieces for four hands, 21 solo sonatas and fantasias, 15 sets of variations, and 18 smaller piano pieces. The twenty-third series contains 17 sonatas for organ with orchestral accompaniment; and in addition there will be a supplemental series containing the most important incomplete works, such as the “ Requiem”’ and the operas L’Oca del Cairo and Lo Sposo deluso, as well as any of those at present supposed to be lost which may come to light while the edition is in progress.', 'The whole of those contained in Book 1 are canons in the octave, No. 4, ‘“ Humoreske,” and No. 6, ‘‘ Tarantelle,” being especially worthy of commendation, the passages in the latter more particularly suggesting not the faintest suspicion that the composer is working in fetters. The Canon in Diminution, named “ Elegie,’ which opens Book 2, is exceedingly interesting, but the best of the series is unquestionably the following one. This commences with a Capriccio in 2-4 time, “ All’ Ongaresse,” entirely given to the second performer. Then we have a Mazurka, in 3-4 time, for both players, and this is succeeded by a movement in which the subject of the opening ‘‘ Capriccio ” is written in the primo part, whilst the secondo has the ‘* Mazurka,” three bars of the former being equivalent to two bars of the latter. The cleverness displayed in this piece is beyond all praise, and we strongly recommend it as a study for young players. The next, “ All’ Antico,” a canon in augmentation, is well written, but scarcely perhaps so attractive as its companions. No. 11, ** Scherzo,” is a good canon in contrary motion, and the last of the series is rather given as a specimen of the manner in which musicians used to amuse themselves in the ‘“‘canonical” days, for the secondo may become the primo with equal effect. We may add that this edition has been carefully fingered by Mr. Charles Hallé.', 'Messrs. Breitkopf and Hartel, as many of our readers will be aware, published some ten years ago a complete edition of Beethoven’s works, and they are at present engaged upon a similar labour for the works of Mendelssohn. Both of these, though extensive undertakings—the Beethoven edition containing 264 works, while that of Mendelssohn, when completed, will comprise 157—are mere child’s play in comparison with an edition of Mozart. It is not merely the number of the works but the extent of many of them which renders the task so colossal. Out of the 626 works given in Kéchel’s Catalogue, about 540 will be included in this edition, the remainder being either lost, not quite com-plete, or of doubtful authenticity.

Some part-songs, under the conductorship of Mr. Little, were sung by a select choir.', 'THESE three pieces are highly favourable specimens of the powers of a composer who is likely to make his way even in the-present crowded state of the market, There is a very decided originality in the treatment of the themes, and a freshness in the design of the movements which should recommend them to the attention of pianists who are wearied with the set forms of the majority of modern compositions. The “Andante et Rondeau,” commencing with a melodious subject in D flat major, derives much character from a syncopated accompaniment, and the graceful flowing theme in E major, gives a welcome contrast to the opening motive. The “Allegro,” in the tonic minor (although written in C sharp migor), contains some really excellent writing, and the skill with which the subject is developed shows that its composer has studied in a good school. The passages will-certainly test the executive powers of even an advanced pianist, but there is sufficient merit in the piece to repay any trouble demanded for its due rendering. The second composition is martial in character, and although not equal in pretension to the one just noticed, is worthy of much commendation.', 'At the last meeting of this season, which was to celebrate the anniversary of Beethoven\'s death, we heard for the first time his Fest-Ouvertiire, ‘Zur Weihe des Hauses,’ a masterpiece in the fugue style, or rather an ancient theme, full of "" original ideas, such as could only occur to Beethoven. His piano-forte concerto in flat major was performed by a Scotch virtuoso, Mr. R. Miiller, who has lately been playing with great success at the courts of Denmark and Sweden. In his style, Mr. Miller distinguishes himself more by his conception and delivery of the intrinsic beauties of the composition, than by imitation of the popular pianists of the day. He shows the highest degree of his ability in the sonatas of Beethoven, in which the most difficult passages, when played by him, appear not as passages merely, but real musical ideas. If we were allowed to express a wish, it would be that Mr. Miller should perform on a solid English instrument to which he has been accustomed, and which under his finger would truly express all the delicate degrees of light and shade. Mr. Miiller, as far as we remember, is the first pianist of Great Britain who has performed publicly on the continent ; and it gives us the more pleasure to admire in him the talents of one of Old England’s artists, because our own German artists have always found in that country the most flattering reception.']",Chopin,Q1268,person,Q15917350,Q15917350,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Haydn is not the single instance of a composer who has passed through such a mental process. It signifies nothing to the argument whether the artist be the inventor or only the illustrator of his theme; Shakspeare’s Tempest may be before his mind’s eye when he paints his fanciful. tone-portrait, or a conceit of a storm at sea with its results that never had action outside his own thoughts, or the loss of the Medusa, or any other veritable shipwreck ; and he may amuse himself, if no one else, by making his music wild or tranquil, agitated or serene, according as bad or good weather prevails in his imagination, and as the fears or hopes are paramount of the voyagers.

But in order to keep up the chain of connection, here it is that I must. deviate somewhat from the course I first prescribed to _myself. Though the singers of the intermediate time between ‘Purcell and Handel, whom I shall consider for our present purpose as an English composer, were chiefly English, yet almost the only compesitions worth notice (except for the church) were. those . of foreign masters. Mrs. Tofts and Mrs. Lindsey were amongst the best, and Dr. Burney has given specimens of the divisions written by A. Scarlatti, and Mare Antonio Bononcini (about 1710), which were ‘sung by these the great sopranos of that time.', 'In the first place we must have regard to the time in which the pieces were played, and from the passages themselves, as well as_ the subsequent improvement of execution, it will be obvious enough that neither. the ipstramentalists or singers of that day had arriyed at any thing like the facility they now possess. Taking this allowance with us we may then say, that the most complicated of Purcell’s divisions i is searcely equal to the easiest to be found in ‘modern songs of execution. If so, we need no longer be at a Joss _to account for the complaints against florid singing, which were vented in those days as in ours, and which indeed have accom) panied the progression of song from the very beginnings of vocal art. In every case the estimate has relation to the state ofthe science and the practice ; ; and as the gradual developement of the powers of singers and the additions they made to the ornamental \x0c APPLICATION OF PASSAGES TO EXPRESSION.’ il parts, outstripped the general judgment founded on the former state of things, so they who had formed their taste in the elder school, and who probably found themselves unequal to the novel difficulties imposed by the example of their juniors, would necessarily from education, habit, association, and deficient ability, condemn what they did not feel in the same way, nor could achieve in the same manner as their younger and better-trained compe- titors.

Another property of this composer’s passages is, that the compass is short : we seldom ‘find any above or below the staff. We ought perhaps to except those he wrote for a base voice, for which he seems to have delighted to compose, ‘and which he tasi:ed at the same time both with execution and expression—a proof of the advancement of the bases in those days beyond the other species. Again, the intervals which succeed each other chiefly lie close together, and are rarely broken into arpeggio. To speak generally, we shall perceive the analogy between the word and the. division to be much more complete than at present, as we have explained in the classification we have made of the words; but more particular detail may perhaps be necessary to make the philosophy of his combinations clearly uaderstood.

A melodious subject for the ‘‘ Pleni sunt cceli’ with an elegant triplet accompaniment for the violins succeeds, and leads with a half cadence on the dominant seventh to the ‘‘ Osanna.” This movement is not, as is generally the case, treated fugally ; with the exception of the ‘‘Cum sancto spiritu,” already noticed, there is no attempt at a fugue throughout the Mass. The present is a bright little chorus in eight parts, short exclamations of the word “ Osanna’ by divided trebles and altos being answered by similarly divided tenors and basses. The “ Benedictus” for soprano, alto, and tenor solos with chorus is a good specimen of a portion of the Mass in which Schubert was invariably successful. It is full of charming and flowing melody, and is certainly one of the best movements in the work. The “ Agnus Dei” is also of much excellence; the modulation at the bottom of p. 88 of the score, and the beautiful treatment of the word “ Miserere,” should be especially noticed. The Dona,” on the other hand, though exceedingly pretty, is in no way great music; itis remarkable for the simplicity of its construction, the voices moving together in plain chords, without the least attempt at counterpoint throughout.', ""The greater part of the ‘“‘ Gloria’? must be pronounced by no means worthy of Schubert’s reputation. It is effective and brilliant music, full of tune, as is everything from its composer's pen; but the first movement might almost be called absolutely commonplace. The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris.

These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', 'and brilliancy of imagination which always rendered his music attractive, and were: sufficient recommendations to raise it to a_ high rank in modern composition. Throughout his works however there was such great want of purity and correctncss of style as to be.a constant drawback on the pleasure derived from hearing them, besides considerably decreasing their value-in the esti- mation of connoisseurs. The following is a list of. his operas :- “& Pandolfo.” 1745; “ La Fata maravigliosa,” 1746 ; Olimpiade,” 1747; Il vello d’oro,”’ 1749; “ Chi tutto abbraccia, nulla stringe,” 1753; “ La Cascina and Statira,” 1756 ; “ La Conversazione, Artaserse, and Alessandro nell’ Indie,” 1758; “ Il Ciarlatano,” 1759; “ La. buona Figluola maritata,”’ 1762: “ Donna stravagante and Schiava riconosciuta,” 1766. Andrea Lucchesi was born at Malta, in the Venetian States, in 1741. He however. received his first: instructions. in music at Naples, where he studied sacred composition under 11 Padre Poalucci, the scholar of the Padre Martini, and dramatic under Cochi. He afterwards received further instructions from Saratelli, the predecessor of Galuppi;, as Chapel Master of St. Mark at Venice. In 1771, Lucchesi went with acompany of opera singers _to Bonn, and entered the service of the Elector of Cologne as Chapel Master, with a salary of 1000 florins.. He excelled greatly as a performer on the organ, which instrument he had studied much in Italy. In composition his manner was light, animated, and agreeable, whilst the perfect purity of his style was very remarkable. In his church music he. was however scrupulously exact as torhythm. His operas are “ L’Isola della Fortuna,” at’ Venice, 1765; Jl Marito geloso, at Venice, and “ Le Donne sempre donne,” 1766; “Jl Matrimonio per astusia,’ A771; “Il Giocatore amoroso,” an interlude for two persons.

It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau. The second work It may be remarked as a singular thing, that the first opera played in France was composed and performed by churchmen; the words were by the Abbé Perrin, the music by Lambert, the organist of Saint Honoré, and all the singers were chosen from the various parishes.

Mendelssohn’s ** Lauda Sion’’—in deference to Exeter Hail audiences, called ‘Praise Jehovah ”—did not show the choir at its best ; and, indeed, it may be said that a body of vocalists 60 Constantly trained to give effect to the massive grandeur of Handel, can scarcely, perhaps, be equally successful in interpreting the more delicately shaded choral pieces of Mendelssohn. On this occasion, however, we must bring a graver charge against the singers, for, in many parts, the intonation was so flat as to cause discomfort to the listeners; and, in consequence of this, much of the best music passed almost unnoticed.

Lemmens has taken as his models the solid compositions of the German school of organ-playing, rather than the light, not to say frivolous, French style so much in favour with some writers, and of which the organ works of Lefébure-Wély, and Batiste are examples. Even where M. Lemmens adopts the modern style—as, for instance, in the middle of the opening movement of the first sonata, where chords for the vox humana are accompanied by the 8-feet flute in the great—he does not degenerate into mere prettiness ; his music is always dignified. The slow movements in all the three sonatas are excellent; but the composer’s special partiality would seem to be for the fugal style. Each sonata contains at least one fugue, and the second hastwo. Tosay that some of these, though very cleverly written, have a suspicion of dryness is no reproach to the composer, because the art of writing a fugue which shall be as interesting as it is ingenious is one of the rarest of musical qualifications. The names “O filii” and ‘« Pascale,” given to the second and third sonatas, refer to the old Latin. hymns “O filii et filie’ and “ Victime paschali,” which are introduced, in the former into the slow movement and in the latter into the finale of the works.', 'We have next an“ Adagio Patetico,” of a mild and sedate cha_ racter, and capable of very great expression under the hands of a _, sensitive player—tbis continues to page 15.

And: as a mere analysis would not give half the pteasure to the student that.a perusal of the piece itself most sutely would afford, we shall gratify ourselves by pointing out to his notice such passages as appear most beautiful in the rondo. Page 17, stave 4,bar the Ist, is an instance of the employment of simple melody, intended to set off subsequent brilliancy, so characteristic of this composer’s ideas.. At page 20 is a recurrence to ecclesiastical ! harmony, which shews that modern taste is not incompatible with ancient style. We like the variation upon this marked “ piu mosso,’ *, stave 3, of same page. After various modulations at page 22, stave 4, we again have the subject, which, with an appropriate repetition of some former passages, concludes the movement, page 23, Expression rather than elaborate execution is the means employed throughout the whole of this sonata, which cannot fail to’ remunerate those who have not yet sacrificed themselves (as too many young ‘players now do) to mere showy and noisy rattling, and who , wish to cultivate classical and feeling music.

Rossini’s invention is extremely limited ; he has only a few phrases which he can call his own, and those he repeats on all occasions, whether they relate to the low intrigues of a barber in Spain, or to the mighty acts of a prophet in’ Egypt.

If her voice has lost some of its former flexibility, she still is unapproachable in her own line, and her addition to the company gave it a completeness unknown for too long a period. Her reception in Norma, the first opera in which she played this year, was most triumphant. The Celtic priestess is peculiarly her own—an exhibition of energetic passion, which, on the Italian stage, we should in vain look for elsewhere. Why should we dwell on Lablache and Persiani? Who is not so familiar with the prince of basses and of vis comica, with the most delicate and florid of sopranos, as to render all comment on them totally unnecessary ? The new operas produced this season have been much more successful than usual. Adelia poor thing as it was—proved a failure certainly ; but Don Pasquale has been fortunate, and Linda di Chamounit has wrested praise even from those who have ever been most determined in their hatred of Donizetti. Certainly Don Pasquale did not produce that furore which we are taught was the result of its performance at Paris; excellent as Lablache was, we have seen him to more advantage in other pieces; but there were many things (the serenade, for instance) in the opera which will alwavs win mobapplause. Nor let us omit the performance of Grisias the Lady Norina in Pasquale, which was one of the most admirable specimens of comic talent ever seen on any stage. The simple and touching style of Linda di Chamouni gave it a character unusual in the works of its composer.']",Lucca,Q86422,person,Q37106905,Q37106905,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

With the latter we had heen introduced one evening into a genial circle of musicians, after which, we find it jotted down as follows: We go out into the moonlight, and, turning some dark eorners—my companion lealing—enter one of thase smoke holes, swarming with beer-drinking life and laughter, distributed about in which,, according to affinities, you mag find the larger part of the intellectual, as well ag the duller male population, on any evening, in every city of Germany. The object is to find an old man who is aupposell ta “‘Kkreip” here, and who, in his wav, is quite a character, And presently thee rose through the ciger smoke, in the further corner, the white head of a tall and rather courtly personage.—high intellectual forehead, strong profile—a face combining eeverity with companionable humor and a spice of drollery even—who greeted us very cordially, and entered eagerly into talk shout America, andabout the musical signs of the times, the old schoo! and the new, &c. Plainiv an oracle amongst his younger con-sodules in that corner, most of whom appeared ta be musical. This was father Wieck, fend of having his own way evidently, hut. genial, witty, and prond (as he might be) ef his daughters, Clara Schumann and the Fraulein Malie.

The old man and our strong young violinist were evidently on the best of terms together. It was pleasant to see them: and +ait was ta sre with what a mixture of admiring affection and respect the young men would address their questions sand remarks to the “Herr Concertmeister,” as Joachim is styled at the cou rt of Hanover, where he controla the music upon terms worthy of the indepen‘lent spirit of an artist, and does not have to drudge in royal church and theatre like the Kapellmeisters of Dresden and most German courts, Again, a few evenings later: The concert over, now imagine a very pleasant, sociable symposium in an upper room of this same nice Hotel de Saxe.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'Ariel and all his quality.” The success of. Der Freischuts had made its author’ s name so popular in England, that nothing could appear to promise greater eclat, than to. engage him to compose and to bring him over to conduct the music for one of the great theatres. At this critical juncture, Mr. C. Kemble, one of the proprietors of Covent Garden, had determined upon accompanying Sir George Smart ina tour through Germany—a tour which may well be termed a tour of inspection, because health, relaxation, and pleasure, were not perhaps so much the objects as the view these artists had to better their professional knowledge, by a personal acquaintance with the progress of the drama and of music in that country of philosophers. | - They therefore made every ‘possible enquiry, and left nothing unsought or unseen that. pertained to the subjects of their pursuit.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

She was planning some musical entertainment for the captains of warships of the Thames squadron, and Viotti was expected; they were also invited who were intimate to the Princess to share the pleasures of the royal family. Catherine, the sister of Queen Elizabeth, was now mistress of Austria, and the powers of the world gathered at Vienna to celebrate her high destinies. This took place in the year 1790. A season of musical festivities, exceedingly gorgeous and splendid for that time, came forth as a prelude under her auspices. Catherine the Second arrived before Fête Dieu (Corpus Christi), and, after court functions and festal receptions, she gave a splendid public ball, where foreign princes and kings came to drink the health of the august personages of her family. Her sisters, the princesses of Orléans, the Palatinate, and Cleves, were present at this royal fête.

In No 2 we find a movement of Pergolesi, but we do not think he could have been guilty of the 8th between extreme parts and the 5th in third and fourth lines of page 11. Whether the progressions appear in the original or not we must blame the editor’s powers either of adaptation or selection. Apart, however, from the musical merit of the series, it seems to us inexpedient to write for the organ on two staves, except in cases where, as in the St. Ann’s Fugue of Bach, the pedal part is omitted for a while, or when only three or four parts move at once.', 'panied recitative, which for tragic situation, for the pathos with which it abounds, and for the vigour it reccives from the orchestra, is a most valuable part of dramatic music. ‘The last act of Didone Abbandonata, composed by him in great part in this style, is finer and more effective as music, than the most terrible and imposing subjects of Giulio Romano are as paintings. ‘Giacomo Antonio Pertit rendered himself equally celebrated in Europe, having been one of the first church composers, and having done much for the science of music by forming such a musician as Fra Giambattista Martini, the mostillustrious of his disciples. N icolo Porpora,§ a Neapolitan, and Renaldo, of Capua, materially improved accompanied recitative—the former by the lightness he gave to the vocal part, and the latter by the use of those instruments best adapted to expression. Pergolesi,|| the great Pergolesi, became jnimitable for simplicity, coupled with grandeur of style, for depth of passion, for natural and vigorous expression, and for justness and unity of design, for which he has deservedly been called the Raphael and the Virgil of Music. Like the first he chose no other guide than nature, and had no other aim than .to represent her faithfully: “ Larte.che tutto fa, nulla si scopre.” Like the second, he adapts inimitably the yarious styles employed in music.

The “‘ Gratias” in A major is far more interesting, yet it contains Jittle which reveals its author. The same can hardly be said of the ‘“ Cum sancto spiritu,” because considered as a fugue it is so very weak that hardly anyone but Schubert could have written it. This seems a bold assertion; but those who are most familiar with the composer’s works are perfectly aware that scientific writing was by no m:ans his forte. In this piece there is hardly even an attempt at counterpoint; and although the full harmonies and the brilliant accompaniments for the violins make very effective and pleasing music, it is almost absurd to describe the movement as a fugue at all, though it was evidently intended for one. The “Credo” is of far higher musical value than the “Gloria.” The opening movement, with its effects for unaccompanied chorus, and its beautiful contrasts of instrumentation, seems to foreshadow the fine setting of the same portion of the text in the Mass in E flat. The “‘ Et incarnatus,” which is in the somewhat unusual form for this movement of an eight-part chorus, is of special excellence, the modulations being very unusual and of remarkable effect. At the ‘ Crucifixus,’’ Schubert ventures on alittle piece of double counterpoint—rather an exceptional thing with him; it is very satisfactory, but some of the intervals for the chorus in this place (pp. 52, 53) will be found by no means easy to sing. The close of the movement pianissimo is very lovely, the effect of the simple harmonic progressions of the voices being heightened by solo passages for the oboe and clarinet in the composer’s happiest manner.

It seems to us that it would be no difficult matter to assign satisfactory reasons for this; but to enter into the subject here would be departing from our main purposes, which are chiefly biographical, and, to a certain extent, critical. In 1658, Mr. Rogers was, by a mandate from the pro_ tector Cromwell, admitted to the degree of bachelor in music by the university of Cambridge. At the restoration, the city of London having invited Charles II., and both houses of parliament, to dine at Guildhall, Rogers was employed to write some music for the occasion, which, Wood tells us, ‘being admirably well done, gave great content, and the author being present, obtained a great name for his composition, and a plentiful reward.’ This consisted of a hymn, beginning ‘ Exultate justi in Domino,’ of which ‘those stanzas daily sung by way of grace after meat at Magdalen College, Oxford, are part,’ as we learn from Sir John Hawkins ; but of the rest, we are not enabled to give any account. He soon after became organist of Eton, and afterwards of Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1669, the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of doctor in music, an honour which did not secure him against a change in fortune, for he died in very straitened circumstances in 1698.']",Crosdill,Q6227740,person,,,0,0,0,0,QID,1,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Teofilo, ‘who has acquired s so great a reputation by his religious compositions, and who was of the school of Clari and Sacchini. In vocal music and poetic expression he formed himself after Zingarelli. We regard Bandonelli as possessing a decided genius for poetry and a fine talent for music. His works are all according to the rules of art, and show great depth of judgment. He has adapted some of » the sonnets of Petrarch, and some of the stanzas of Japo, with so much talent and care, that every one has its precise and technical value. He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author. If Ban‘donelli were as original, and rich in invention as he is happy in the choice of his melodies, he would acquire an immortal title to celebrity.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art! Grazioli (who must not be confounded with the composer of the same name, who died at Venice in 1820) .', 'Fabio Constantini flourished about the year 1630, and ultimately became maestro at the chapel of Loretto. His compositions are very good, and are formed after the models of Palestrina and his immediate successors.

Urb. Cathedralis Musice prefecto in lucem edite.” Philippo Nicoletti, who flourished at the sane time with the last-mentioned composer, published several madrigals, which were much admired by his ceuntrymen; also a great deal of church music, and he became chapel-master to one of the cathedrals of Rome.. | The next composer who claims our attention was one w ho con‘tributed greatly towards the. improvement of madrigals, a species of composition at that time much wanting the hand ofa skilful musician to carry it to perfection. Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.']",Marcello,Q312784,person,Q37190638,Q37190638,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually. I-esteem such a circumstance to be rather honourable in the comparison I have endeavoured to maintain, because even under the most unfavourable influence, English genius developed and manifested its powers. Nothing can more clearly demonstrate my position than the history of Arne, given in the Review to which [have just referred.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'She had expressed a preference for other oratorios, as being more to her taste for dramatic effect; but one could only wonder, if she sang so well in this what could she do in those. Mr. Netson Variey sustained the tenor solos with the utmost grace and expression, It is rare that we hear an oratorio singer so nearly faultless, and this, not in regard to a fine solo, but in the entire work; he was fnily alive to the beauties before him, and every note was a source of satisfaction. His rendering of the aria, “In Native Worth,” is to be remembered for a lifetime. 1 called forth the most generous and hearty encore, to which he responded with great good humor and the happiest effect, even outdoing his first effort. Dr. Guitmerre, as. “Raphael,” added one more wreath to the laurels he ever wins.in oratorio Tnusic, and sang so superbly as to astonish his old friends. The breadth and grandeur of his tones, and the beautiful execution of diffienlt passages delighted all, In singing “Thro’ silent vales the limpid brook,” he went with utmost ease to D below the staff, with a clearness and sostenuio that thrilled the audiende, and produced that powerful silence which is so satisfactory aud complimentary to all who win ity while, in “Now heaven in fullest glory shone,” his voice soared to F sharp with an élan that so electrified all, that it was with difficulty they could restrain the storm of applause which followed his last note. All this was assisted by a chorus whose attack was superb; and in the fugue movements and telling points of all the choruses, they were simply perfect, winning applause continudusly, not only from the audience, but the most marked expressions ofdelight and satisfaction from the soloista and orchestra, who indeed did-not hesitate to speak of their excelling any other choral society in the country, This coming from soloists whose experience is large in this and the oid country, makes it a compliment and ax opinion of no small weight.', 'The first part of the e@ was occupied by Sallivan’s Oratorio, ‘* The Prodigal Son 3” the soloists ing Misa Isabel Weale, Miss Marion Severn, Mr. Stedman, and Mr. F.

Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually. I-esteem such a circumstance to be rather honourable in the comparison I have endeavoured to maintain, because even under the most unfavourable influence, English genius developed and manifested its powers.

From causes which I shall explain presently, he never knew well how to select the pieces to which he wrote music. The book of Ledoiska, of which we are now speaking, is a childish work, whether we consider the plot itself, or the manner of writing it out.

Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm. Cramer as leader of the Opera band, an office that he did not long retain, for in 1798 the susceptible feelings of this admirable artist were destined to expede piano, a work in which she progressively conducts her pupils from the simplest to the greatest difficulties, is well known to the public.']",Fétis,Q523581,person,Q55530312,Q55530312,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

As our own course of reading necessarily runs in the same track, we may be allowed to pronounce upon this point with some small share of authority, and we cannot,commend either the matter and the manner too highly. Se a It remains for us only to advert to some of the more novel parts, for it would be alike impossible and useless to attempt a further The first circumstances that claims our notice are the particular effects which were observed. We have already described many of the grander features in our article on the York Festival,* which coincide with the account given by our author. Amongst those which remain, the first was the effect of the trumpet in “ Sound an-alarm,” and Martin Luther's Hymn.” “ The sound of the trumpet, proceeding from nearly the top of the orchestra, appeared as if it descended from the open space of the tower above; and the thrill of awe, not unmingled even with terror, which it produced, was such as we shall not attempt to describe.” oe ee The next is upon the subject of the quantity of base necessary to the foundation of a band. Speaking of the performance of Haydn’s chorus, La Tempesta, Mr. C. says— Bo We were also strengthened in the opinion, that productions of this class of art, and especially of modern art, require more power of bass than has ever yet been concentrated, to create an effect equal to that which entered into the imagination of the composer; since not all the weight of double basses, trombones, &c, bottomed on the diapason‘of the organ, was found sufficient to satisfy the craving of the ear. A similar observation was made with respect to the great Abbey festival of 1791, where the power, nevertheless, was above double that of the York band, and ina more contracted space. We venture, therefore, to hazard: an opinion, grounded on the result of the Abbey meetings, and of ."", 'Holmes. was of the greatest reputation: he was principal bassoon at the Concert of Antient Music in London, where he was.', 'M, Feris is employed on a history of music.']",Goss,Q345870,person,Q21492513,Q21492513,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

Urb. Cathedralis Musice prefecto in lucem edite.” Philippo Nicoletti, who flourished at the sane time with the last-mentioned composer, published several madrigals, which were much admired by his ceuntrymen; also a great deal of church music, and he became chapel-master to one of the cathedrals of Rome.. | The next composer who claims our attention was one w ho con‘tributed greatly towards the. improvement of madrigals, a species of composition at that time much wanting the hand ofa skilful musician to carry it to perfection. Domenico Mazzochi was born at Rome, and gained much credit there both for his musical. composition and discoveries in this style. His first production was an oratorio, entitled “J/ Martirio di Sant’ Abbondio,” which was received at Rome with great applause ; he afterwards wrote several others, which were not less highly appreciated. His madrigals are excellent in themselves, being very refined in their execution, besides presenting several new combinations, and a more bold. and masterly use of discords in ligature than can be found in the works of any of his predecessors. He invented the characters of crescendo, diminuendo, piano, forte, and the enharmonic sharp. These inventions were not long in passing from theatrical and chamber music to that of ‘the church, thus doubly illustrating the fame of their author, and contributing powerfully to the perfection of united melody and harmony.', ""It appears that Salvator cultivated this art earlier than his own.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""]",Wilson,Q6264502,person,Q1645480,Q1645480,1,1,0,0,QID,0,0.869753979739508,0.8099730458221024,0.8387997208653175

These works are . written in the style of Graun. He returned to Strelitz, where he married a singer, a pupil of the celebrated Astrua. After this he passed to the service of the Duke of Holstein, in the capacity of master of the chapel. . In 1763 he composed a grand cantata for the chapel of Sonderhausen, which was performed at a féte on the birth-day of the Prince of Swartzburg. There are by him six sonatas, in three parts, for the violin or flute, engraved at Amsterdam; also many cantatas for the church, concertos for the violin, oboe symphonies, &c. &c. in manuscript.', 'About the year 1653, having the reputation of being an admirable composer, he, ‘at the request of great personages,’ says Anthony Wood, ‘composed several sets of ayres of four parts, to be performed by violins and an organ, which being esteemed the best of their kind that could be then composed, were sent as great rarities into Germany, to the . court of Archduke Leopold (afterwards Emperor), and often played by his (the prince’s) own musicians, he himself being a composer, and great admirer of music.’ And here we may remark, en passant, that, less than two cen_turies ago, English music was held in high estimation ia Germany, and there sought after by the cognoscenti: now hardly a page of it is to be met with in the whole of that great, that very musical country, a country on which we depend for almost every work of excellence produced at our concerts, or listened to in our drawing-rooms.

The abundant means s command are never squandered upon outward o show, but judiciously spent on a well-regulated, comfortable household.” We are permitted a glimpse of this happy family in the sanctum of home—almost the last glimpse before the shadow of death falls over all. It was Mendelssohn’s birthday, and his friends combined to keep it with due festivity. Moscheles must describe the revels :—‘‘ The proceedings were opened wifh a capital comic scene between two ladies’ maids, acted, in the Frankfort dialect, by Cécile (Madame Mendelssohn) andher sister. Then came a Charade on the word ‘ Gewandhaus,’ Joachim, adorned with a fantastic wig, @ la Paganini, played a hare-brained Impromptu on the G string. The syllable ‘wand’. was represented by the Pyramus and Thisbe wall-scene from the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ;’ for ‘haus’ Charlotte (Mrs. Moscheles) acted a scene she had written herself, in which she is discovered knitting a blue stocking, and soliloquizing on the foibles of female authoresses, advising them to attend to their domestic duties.', 'In the first concert Madame Catalani sung a recitative, “ Pegno piu grato,” and an aria, “ Mio Ben,” concerning the author of which Mr. Crosse expresses some doubts. We have reason to believe the recitative to be the production of Madame C. herself, and the air has so long been publishéd with Pucitta’s name, that we entertain little doubt of its being his. The preface to the oratorio of the Messiah is a succinct account of the invention and progress of this species of composition, written in asimilar manner to that of the concerts. In the course of his narrative, Mr. Crosse has thrown new light on the assertion of Sir. J. Hawkins, “that the Messiah was first performed in 1741, and coldly received.” Mr. C. gives reasons which render it probable that it was not brought out till 1742, and that it was from the first highly estimated. Sir J. Hawkins however was a man of such determined accuracy, that he rarely if ever hazarded a fact but on good grounds. Wecanstateso much on the most certain authority. Upon tlie accompaniments of Mozart to the Messiah, Mr. Crosse has introduced some able and sound observations, and in: an admirable temper. Mr. Crosse also distinguishes Mr. Vaughan’s singing “‘ Thy rebuke,” and the succeeding air, with particular encomium.
