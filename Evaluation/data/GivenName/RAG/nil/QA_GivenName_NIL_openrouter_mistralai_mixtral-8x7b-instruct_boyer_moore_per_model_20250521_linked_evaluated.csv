Question: ""What is the given name of Mrs. Wood?""

Answer:","Answer: Mrs. 
Explanation: In this case, ""Mrs."" is the given name, as it is a title that represents the given name of a married woman. However, this title does not reveal the exact name, and it is not possible to determine from the sentence if the person's original given name was ""Mrs."" or if it was shortened from ""Missus"" (which is a title for a married woman derived from her husband's name). Therefore, we can only conclude that the given name in this sentence is ""Mrs."".",NIL,person,,,0,QA_GivenName_nil_noctx_openrouter_mistralai_mixtral-8x7b-instruct_20250424_linked.csv,ZS,mistralai_mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,,,,,0,0,,ZS+RAG,Boyer-Moore-50pct,0.5,False,0,0,0,NIL,0,0.47058823529411764,0.43636363636363634,0.45283018867924524

for word in split_sentence:
    if person in word:
        given_name = word.strip().split()[-1]

Explanation:
First, the sentence is split into a list of words using the `split()` function with a comma as the separator. Then, the list of words is iterated over to find the word that contains the person's name. Once that word is found, the `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, and the `split()` function is used to split the word into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The last item in the list (which will be the given name) is then assigned to the variable `given_name`.

Question: ""What is the given name of the Duchess of Cambridge?""

Answer:","The answer is: ; Duchess;

The reason is that ""given name"" typically refers to the first name in a personal name. However, the person in question is a royal title, specifically ""the Duchess of Cambridge"". In this case, ""Duchess"" is the title, and ""Cambridge"" is the name of the duchy, but neither is a given name.
