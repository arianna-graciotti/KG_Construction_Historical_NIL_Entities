Question: ""What is the given name of R. S. Jackson?""

Answer:","R. S.

To justify the answer, the original sentence from the input provides direct evidence for identifying the given name(s). Examining the original sentence again:

""The Organ can be seen any evening by appointment made by letter addressed to R. S. Jackson, Esq., Solicitor, 5, St. Benet – place, City.""

The sentence mentions ""R. S. Jackson"" as a direct reference to the person of interest, and it indicates that ""R. S."" is the given name of the person since ""Jackson"" is naturally seen as their last name. The context documents do not provide additional information about the name ""R. S. Jackson"" that could lead to other given names. Therefore, the answer to the question ""What is the given name of R. S. Jackson?"" is ""R.

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings.

The ‘Agnus Dei” is a perfect gem. The theme, commenced in octaves by the two soprani, and afterwards joined by the chorus, then given in the minor by the solo voices, and harmonised in the instrumentation, came as a veritable inspiration upon the audience, and at its conclusion the applause could scarcely be subdued, even by..the repetition of the movement. Beautiful also is the ‘“ Lachrymosa,” the effect of the plaintive notes of the mezzo-soprano against the bass solo, giving a depth of expression to the words almost in..describable, These two movements are perhaps amongst the purest specimens of spontaneous writing in the work; but we must also instance the “ Recordare,” the bass-solo “Confutatis” (although we can scarcely reconcile ourselves to the sequence of fifths which accompanies it), and the final “ Libera me;”” but in naming these we need scarcely say that they comprise only a small portion of the many charming pieces in a composition which cannot fail to take a permanent place amongst the accepted works of modern composers. The solo parts were admirably sustained by Madame Stolz, Madame Waldmann, ‘Signor Masini, and Signor Medini, the first named lady displaying a clear and liquid soprano voice, eminently suited to give the utmost effect to Signor Verdi’s music. Madame Wald‘mann was also in every respect highly satisfactory, and both tenor and bass acquitted themselves of their arduous task most successfully, Signor Masini, however, occasionally indulging in a tremolo which much detracted from the effect of his really beautiful voice. The choruses were finely sung by the Royal Albert Hall Choir (which had been previously well drilled by Mr. Barnby), and the orchestra was everything that could be desired. Signor Verdi, who conducted, received quite an ovation, and was evidently much pleased with the manner in which his music had been prepared. In consequence of the great success of the work, two special representations, at popular prices, were given on the 22nd and 2oth ult. (both under the conductorship of the composer), before large audiences.'}

Once while walking home from one of Spontini’s operas (Nurmahal), where not only ‘all kinds of trumpets, drums, tympans and trombones, but also thirty iron anvils, tuned in different keys, had clashed and thundered,—and, in passing the royal castle and- hearing the great tattoo, an_ ensemble of ‘bands, trumpeters, drummers, pipers, and horners, of the whole garrison, Zelter exclaimed to his friends, ‘‘Heaven be’ praised | after all this opera-hoise we hear at last a little sweet music. 7 7 Such a don-mot sinks often decper into a young composer's heart than a whole course of instruction. Spontini had found already many adinirers among the youthful artists who would extend a musical theme in the same. unskilled manner, who loved his long crescendos and mighty fortissimos ; but such remarks as Zelter’s would check many in this course."", '185 giving extra force to it in each place, by reference to the ‘other.
