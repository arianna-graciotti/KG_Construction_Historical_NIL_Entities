He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing?

{'TheMusicalTimes_1873-366.txt_p366': 'Indeed, both men appear to have sometimes come very near combining want of dignity with want of reverence. ‘They often play to one another Beethoven’s Sonatas,” says Mrs. Moscheles, “ which not unfrequently diverge into joint improvisations of the maddest kind, and musical caricatures. On one occasion the nursery song ‘ Polly, put the kettle on’ is chosen for a subject on purpose te please the two little girls.” All this—in Mendelssohn’s case, a any rate—was but the reaction of too severe a strain upon a finely-strung and sensitive organisation.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p126': 'We never heard Madame Dulcken play better ;—in the immensely difficult quintet of Spohr, especially, and in the picturesque sonata of Beethoven, she absolutely astouished her audience. The wind instruments were delicious ; the names of Ribas, Laza rus, Jarrett, and Baumann, were a sufficient guarantee for this. The quintet of Onslow, went to perfection. We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.', 'TheHarmonicon_1824-016.txt_p29': 'sometimes with the double chord, sometimes with finely shaded arpeggios, at others with passages crescendo and decrescendo in the higher regions of the strings, but without ever passing the limit of appreciable sounds; and all this in such a manner as to produce the most extraordinary contrasts, and, by a sonorous, and if I may so express it, a magnetic vibration of the chord, could cause emotions almost as lively and profound as those produced by the human voice.” The only vocal music which Viotti composed are two polonaise airs, or polaccas, which are chefs-d’euvres in their kind ; the one is Che gioja, che contento! which was sung by Viganoniin La Villanella rapita; the other is the air, Consola, amato bene, the rhythm of which bears a great similarity to the polonaise of V. Martini, in La Cosz rara, beginning La Donna a dolce il core. Dussek has given charming variations to both of these. The principal disciples of the school of Viotti are Rode, Libon, Alday, La Barre, Vacher, Cartier, Pixis, Mad.'}

Each of these great masters played a solo, and soon observed the enthusiasm “with which they inspired the young artist. Ferrari gave. him his violin; Lahoussaye not only preluded: on it in avery brilliant manner, but even played by ear several passages of a sonata of Tartini’s which Pagin had just performed. He received high praises from these artists, and above all from Pagin, whoadopted him as his scholar: he some time after procured a situation as violinist at the concerts of the Prince Count de.Clermont. Inspite however of the great advantages which Lahoussaye now enjoyed, he could not overcome the desire he had always felt to see Tartini.', 'In 1790, one of the deputies of the Assemblée Constituante, who had a range of apartments on the fifth floor of a house, prevailed upon Viotti, who was his intimate friend, to give a concert at his chambers. Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England.

Signor Curioni, Porto, and. Pellegrini supported the ordinary routine of the opera with the. sustentation their solid qualities .', 'To sum up her attributes then—she has a fine sensibility and a just conception—an intonation seldom incorrect—execution perfected and regulated by profound science. Her voice is defective, and never will the hearer be so convinced of the truth of the Italian maxim, that “a fine voice is ninety-nine of the hundred requisites of a singer,” as in hearing Madame Pasta—for possessing all the rest, the absence of the physical pleasure we derive from fine tone, is a drawback frem the general gratification of no small magnitude. It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be.

At the second performance his enthusiasm was unbounded, and he exclaimed, ‘“‘ As a singer Mademoiselle Schechner has no equal upon earth !” The impression produced by this lady, is thus described in an article printed in the Journal of Professor Voss :— “‘ Yesterday evening, Mademoiselle Schechner terminated a series of performances with a degree of éclat, which, perhaps, no other singer ever experienced. The public enthusiasm redoubled at each representation, and it is but justice to acknowledge, that never was feeling better founded. Is it not surprising that a singer, whose mame was scarcely known here eighteen months ago, should have so suddenly raised herself to the first rank, and established her claim as the first dramatic singer of the day? She has been with us but four months, and yet in that short period how,sgreat the sensation she has produced.

The great drawback upon her singing was an occasional infirmity in the’ sustaining power, not unlike, though not to the same extent, as the trembling of voice observed in Mademoiselle Bonini. “But she is certainly an artist of the first class, though eclipsed by the forcibly and sublime expression of Pasta, and by the extraordinary facility of Sontag.* Mademoiselle Brambilla has not had much to do, especially during the latter part of the season, after the ‘engagement of Madame Schutz, but-the richness of her voice, her pure manner, and the beauty of her person have won upon her audiences.

It is also singular that her shake is exceedingly imperfect. But the want of this ornament is now we believe common to all Italian singers. In person Madame P. is short but well formed, and upon the stage wacommonly easy and dignified, particularly i in male characters. At all times she is graceful, but in particular passages she is more affecting than we conceived she could be. Her recitativo parlante i is far above that of most performers, and we must repeat that her entire manner exhibits the force of sensibility, intellect, and science, in the use of organic powers generally speaking far below those possessed by singers of so high a class. .', 'TheHarmonicon_1828-001.txt_p865': 'The author of Die Vestalin, was heard to declare, that this was the first time his conceptions of the character had been fully realized.
