He was considered high in his art—but as his rank in life preciuded the necessity of his appearing before the public, his performance, amongst the ‘numerous talent which embellished the age in which he flourished, was not generally remarked. | 7 : Not so Pierre Lahoussaye, who was born at Paris i in 1736, and VOL, VII.

The same impulse that inspired the words, has generally given birth to the music, and those that are the most celebrated have been produced with the least trouble. I began and completed The Satlur’s Journal in half an hour; and I could mention, perhaps, thirty very prominent songs, that did not take, im the writing and composing, more than three quarters cf an hear each.”—“ No one of my entertainments has taken me more than a month in perfecting it.” J haye written, exclusive of Sans Souci*, nearly seventy dramatic pieces of different descriptions, besides having set to music fifteen or sixteen, the productions of other writers. In the whole of those which I have invented and brought forward, are included more than nine hundred songs.” —“ I have never written down my compositions till they were wanted, either for a band, or for the engraver. I have now in my mind at least thirty songs, nearly twenty of which I have sung in public; of the music of which not even a single note has yet been written.” : In our next number we shall republish his own interesting account of his dramatic works.'}

Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.', 'In the first concert Madame Catalani sung a recitative, “ Pegno piu grato,” and an aria, “ Mio Ben,” concerning the author of which Mr. Crosse expresses some doubts. We have reason to believe the recitative to be the production of Madame C. herself, and the air has so long been publishéd with Pucitta’s name, that we entertain little doubt of its being his. The preface to the oratorio of the Messiah is a succinct account of the invention and progress of this species of composition, written in asimilar manner to that of the concerts. In the course of his narrative, Mr. Crosse has thrown new light on the assertion of Sir. J. Hawkins, “that the Messiah was first performed in 1741, and coldly received.” Mr. C. gives reasons which render it probable that it was not brought out till 1742, and that it was from the first highly estimated. Sir J. Hawkins however was a man of such determined accuracy, that he rarely if ever hazarded a fact but on good grounds. Wecanstateso much on the most certain authority.

Person: ""Braun""
Sentence: ""Once again the same very peculiar metre appears in a hymn tune which Dr. Gauntlett ascribes to one Braun (whoever he may have been) as the author, and to the year 1675 asthe date; and this coincidence, if the ascription be authentic, is as curious as the other.""

{'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p524': 'Many of his anthems are of real musical value; but it is as a composer of psalm-tunes that he will be best remembered hereafter. Such tunes as “St, Alphege” and “St. George” in ‘Hymns Ancient and Modern,” and Nos. 169, 197, 329; 426 and 554 in “The Hymnary,” are among the best modern compositions for Church use that have been produced. But Dr. Gauntlett was not merely a composer; he also possessed considerable literary qualifications. His contributions to the ‘ Musical World,” when that periodical was originally established, and more recently to the ‘‘ Orchestra,” were not merely full of information, but written frequently in a very amusing, though at times slightly eccentric, style. He was, moreover, in his day an organist of high attainments, though of late he had been but seldom heard in public. He was one of the first and most persistent advocates in this country of the German system of organ-building; and some of the finest instruments in England were constructed under his direction. He was for many years organist at St. Olave’s, Southwark, and subsequently at Dr. Allon’s chapel at Islington; and the high reputation which the latter place deservedly enjoys for congregational singing is largely due to his exertions during the thirteen years he directed the musical portion of the services there.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p810': 'In the first concert Madame Catalani sung a recitative, “ Pegno piu grato,” and an aria, “ Mio Ben,” concerning the author of which Mr. Crosse expresses some doubts. We have reason to believe the recitative to be the production of Madame C. herself, and the air has so long been publishéd with Pucitta’s name, that we entertain little doubt of its being his. The preface to the oratorio of the Messiah is a succinct account of the invention and progress of this species of composition, written in asimilar manner to that of the concerts. In the course of his narrative, Mr. Crosse has thrown new light on the assertion of Sir. J. Hawkins, “that the Messiah was first performed in 1741, and coldly received.” Mr. C. gives reasons which render it probable that it was not brought out till 1742, and that it was from the first highly estimated. Sir J. Hawkins however was a man of such determined accuracy, that he rarely if ever hazarded a fact but on good grounds. Wecanstateso much on the most certain authority. Upon tlie accompaniments of Mozart to the Messiah, Mr. Crosse has introduced some able and sound observations, and in: an admirable temper.

This annual assemblage of the Yorkshire Amateurs has been honourably, though not quite correctly, noticed in some of the periodical musical reports. During the series of years that it has now existed, it has been the chief rallying point for the lovers of music in this extensive county, and almost the only opportunity which they enjoyed of. being brought together in harmonious contact. Its influence, therefore, when the union of hearts and the improvement of taste, which it has created and diffused, are considered, cannot but have been most beneficial, even on the greater festival of the year; and as all its members and supporters were interested also in the success of the latter attempt, a short account of their musical exertions will not be deemed wholly out of place in the present narrative. The Yorkshire amateur meeting takes place annually, towards the end. of June, at Sheffield, Leeds, and York, in rotation; it having originated in the former town in the year 1809.'}

G. Cusins), and a selection from his harp studies, displayed Mr. Thomas’s powers, both as a composer and executant, to the utmost advantage, and in all these pieces he was warmly and déservedly applauded. He also performed two of Mendelssohn’s “Lieder chne Worte ” and gome Welsh melodies, arranged by himself for the harp, which proved highly effective. The vocalista were Miss Edith Wynne, Madame Nita Gaetano, Mdlle. Elene Angéle, Madame Patey, Signor Gardoni, Mr. Vernon Rigby, Mr. Lewis Thomas and M. Jules Lefort.

P. Very little attention (as he justly observes) ‘has of late years been paid to the improvement of our cathedral duty, and what is certainly rather extraordinary, less has been done by composers for this branch of science than even by the singers. Several times I have thought of troubling you with an article on this subject, pointing out what I should conceive some improvement in the service: I have even had the temerity to think of recommending the non-performance of some of the very old dry services and anthems (my sacrilegeous thoughts do not extend to productions by Gibbons or Purcell)—but I do say, that to people who have any ear for music, and who are in the habit of attending the different cathedrals, it must be tiresome in the extreme, especially if they are not profound contrapuntists, to hear the changes rung upon a certain set of Te Deums and. Anthems, dull enough in themselves, but rendered intolerably so by diurnal repetition. I must however notice, that at the Chapel Royal some chants of Mr. S. Wesley’s have lately been. intro= duced, that are delightful for sound harmony and originality, and that- Mr, Attwood has had performed some new commandments of his, which do the highest credit to his. judgment and science ; the construction of them is quite novel for this part of the service. This first response, ‘Lord have mercy,” &c. is formed upon a canto fermo, in plain counterpoint of four parts; canto fernio in the treble. The next response. (after the second commandment)', '‘he pretty organ parts came out very distinctly and with much delicacy. The address, which was appropriate to the occasion, was delivered by the Vicar. The rev. gentleman described the organ of voice and its mode of action in emitting musical sounds, and dwelt upon the desirability and practicability of congregational singing. Want of space prevents us from following the vicar’s address, which was . decidedly interesting and instructive, though we cannot ee with him in some of his remarks on music.

P. Very little attention (as he justly observes) ‘has of late years been paid to the improvement of our cathedral duty, and what is certainly rather extraordinary, less has been done by composers for this branch of science than even by the singers. Several times I have thought of troubling you with an article on this subject, pointing out what I should conceive some improvement in the service: I have even had the temerity to think of recommending the non-performance of some of the very old dry services and anthems (my sacrilegeous thoughts do not extend to productions by Gibbons or Purcell)—but I do say, that to people who have any ear for music, and who are in the habit of attending the different cathedrals, it must be tiresome in the extreme, especially if they are not profound contrapuntists, to hear the changes rung upon a certain set of Te Deums and. Anthems, dull enough in themselves, but rendered intolerably so by diurnal repetition. I must however notice, that at the Chapel Royal some chants of Mr. S. Wesley’s have lately been. intro= duced, that are delightful for sound harmony and originality, and that- Mr, Attwood has had performed some new commandments of his, which do the highest credit to his. judgment and science ; the construction of them is quite novel for this part of the service. This first response, ‘Lord have mercy,” &c. is formed upon a canto fermo, in plain counterpoint of four parts; canto fernio in the treble. The next response. (after the second commandment)', 'TheMusicalTimes_1873-366.txt_p456': '‘he pretty organ parts came out very distinctly and with much delicacy. The address, which was appropriate to the occasion, was delivered by the Vicar.

The festival was brought to a close on the z4th ult., a novelty in the programme being Raff's Symphony in E, No.5, which elicited much applause and excited the deepest interest. .Mr. Hallé was again the pianist, and Madame Sterling and Mr. Lloyd the singers. In every respect the performances have been highly successful, and Mr. Hallé deserves every credit for the admirable manner in which he conducted.""}

Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M. Puppo, listen to my friend M. Lahoussaye, and you will be able to form an idea how Tartini played.” Mr. Viotti remained in Paris till the unhappy revolution in 1790, which chased away the Muses from that devoted capital, when he joined the fugitives and escaped to England. In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm. Cramer as leader of the Opera band, an office that he did not long retain, for in 1798 the susceptible feelings of this admirable artist were destined to expede piano, a work in which she progressively conducts her pupils from the simplest to the greatest difficulties, is well known to the public.'}

The Marquis of Westminster, in the course of his address to the meeting, stated that the number of blind throughout the country was. estimated at about 30,000, and of these he believed that only 2,250, were instructed or assisted. The object of this College is so to educate persons thus afflicted as to enable them to maintain themselves by teaching music and tuning pianofortes. The subscriptions received arhounted to about £1,000, and the Committee have now £6,000, towards the £25,000, which will be required. It is \x0c sincerely to be hoped that the efforts of those who have exerted themselves in this benevolent cause will be tangibly rewarded by the collection of a sum amply sufficient to place so desirable an Institution upon a permanant basis. .', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p530': 'THE gathering of professors and students in the new Concert-room of the Royal Academy of Music, on the-3rd ult., was a highly interesting event, not only because a spacious and well-ventilated hall had been at length secured for the rehearsals and performances of the pupils in the building itself, but because the growing public interest in the Academy, and the enormous increase in the number of the students, justified the supposition that, with the enlargement of premises, the Institution would commence a career of additional usefulness to art and artists. The acoustical properties of the room were most satisfactorily tested by Mr. W. H. Holmes in several pianoforte works, and by the choir in a number of well-selected vocal pieces ; and when, in the committee-room, after the little impromptu concert, “ success to the future of the Royal Academy of Music” was proposed, it was gratifying to see, amongst those who honoured the toast, two eminent musicians who, on the 8th of March, 1823—a fortnight before the first lesson was given—were elected on the foundation of the institution.'}
