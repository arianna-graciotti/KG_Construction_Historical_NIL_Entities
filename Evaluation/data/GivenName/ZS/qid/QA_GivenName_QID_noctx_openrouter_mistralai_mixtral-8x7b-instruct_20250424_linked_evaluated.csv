(Explanation: The question asks for the given name(s) of the person, and in this case, the person's name is ""Mr. Sims Reeves"". The given name is ""Sims"", and there is no second given name. Therefore, the answer is ""Sims"". However, the format of the answer must be ""givenName1; givenName2; ..."" and so the answer must be ""Sims;"" rather than just ""Sims"". Similarly, there is no second given name, so the answer must end with a semicolon rather than a space. Hence, the answer ""Sims;"". It would be inappropriate to include ""reeves"" as a given name, as it is actually a surname. Including it would not conform to the format requested, and would provide incorrect information.

Sentence: ""The performance of the work in St. James's Hall, under Myr. Otto Goldschmidt, had many good points, and Mr. Parry found no small part of a friendly audience willing to bestow applause.""
Question: ""What is the given name of Myr . Otto Goldschmidt?""

Answer:","Myr;

Here's the explanation:

1. We are looking for the given name(s) of ""Myr . Otto Goldschmidt"" in the sentence ""The performance of the work in St. James's Hall, under Myr. Otto Goldschmidt, had many good points, and Mr. Parry found no small part of a friendly audience willing to bestow applause.""
2. We can identify ""Myr. Otto Goldschmidt"" as the person of interest in the sentence.
3. In this case, ""Myr"" is the given name of the person because it is used before the title ""Mr."" which typically follows the given name.
4. Therefore, the answer is ""Myr"".

Note: If the sentence had been ""The performance of the work in St. James's Hall, under Otto Goldschmidt, Myr., had many good points, and Mr. Parry found no small part of a friendly audience willing to bestow applause."", then the answer would have been ""Myr; Otto"", as ""Myr"" is a title in this case, and ""Otto"" is the given name.
