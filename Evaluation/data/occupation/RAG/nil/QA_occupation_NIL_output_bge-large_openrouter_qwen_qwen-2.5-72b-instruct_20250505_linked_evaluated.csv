On peut dire qu’il n’y eut jamais d’entreprise plus difficile; le langage musical est ingrat et insolite ; 4 chaque instant les mots vont me manquer ; et quand j’aurais le bonheur d’en trouver pour exprimer ma pensée, ils présenteraient un sens peu clair 4 esprit du lecteur. D/ailleurs il n’est peut-¢tre pas un dillettante qui n’ait sa phrase toute faite sur Mademoiselle Pasta, et qui ne soit mécontent de ne pas la retrouver ici; et dans Ja juste admiration que cette grande cantatrice inspire au public, le lecteur le plus bienveillant trouvera son portrait sans couleur, et mille fois au-dessous de ce qu’il attendait.”” ° If such are the difficulties which the biographer of Haydn, Mozart, and Rossini, anticipated—if he who appears to have passed the larger portion of his life in following and observing the great’ public singers of his age, feared to encounter them in attempting to describe this celebrated female, our dismay should be infinitely increased. For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect. We also labour under an embarrassment of which few can calculate the force, namely, the disadvantage which resides in the simple fact that the writer is an. Englishman born and bred. For we are quite sure that Englishmen do not feel, even by natural constitution, as Italians feel. The distance is still further widened by education, and therefore the two nations express their sensations in a manner very unlike to one another.'}

I am not severe—this is the rule of fashionable life. The few contraries which opulence exhibits are the exceptions, But, Sir, how long, I ask, will art continue to be cultivated, when ‘those who have hitherto been and ought always to be its brightest patrons and its ablest supporters, have ceased to take any personal share, and consequently have lost the pure relish which participation alone bestows, and I will say, the only inducement which can long tempt any one to cultivate the arts.', 'DwightSJournalOfMusic_1868-012.txt_p151': 'existence.

In the vastness of its outline, the restlessness of its character, and the minuteness of its detail, it forcibly reminded us of a work recently produced by a young Englishman (Mr. Charles Horsley), with brilliant success, at one of the soirées of the “Society of British Musicians.’ How delighted should we have been to hear the talents of the four distinguished artists who interpreted it, with Sterndale Bennett at their head, bestowed upon this fine work of a brother musician! What would we not give to hear Bennett's interpretation of the work which we but lately spoke of with such sincere enthusiasm—and which is not only admirably suited to his style of execution, but is scarcely inferior in merit to the quartet of Mendelssohn, which was executed on Monday night with such wonderful energy and power! Who knows but we may yet hear it atthe third soirée? Poor Miss Ley, who has a delicious soprano voice, was too frightened at her audience (and no wonder) to leave us any opportunity of judging of her capabilities as a vocalist; she was very indulgently received, however.

He states that, in the event of his fixing at Genoa as his last resting place on earth, he will open an academy of music there, for instruction in his own system, by which he insists that two-thirds of the time new occupied in obtaining a proficiency in music may be saved. We understand from a friend of Paganini, who is well acquainted with his. affairs, that his gains in this country amounted to twentythree thousand four hundred pounds, and that his entire fortune exceeds seventy thousand pounds, a great part of which he has settled on his natural son, Achilles—a precocious child, on whom he doats. There are, it is said, some curious restrictions in the settlement on his son. He is not to enjoy the property if his trustees detect him in gambling, or if he should ever become manager of a theatre.

The refined and intellectual performance of Miss Zimmermann was the theme of general admiration in all these pieces; and as she had the cooperation of Herr Straus (violm) and Herr Daubert (violoncello) it is needless to say that the general rendering of each work left nothing to be desired. Of Miss Zimmermann’s Sonata we recorded our highly favourable opinion when played by the composer and Madame NormanNeruda last year at the Hanover-square Rooms; and we have now only to say that. it was received by the audience with equal marks of favour. Schumann’s “ Etudes Symphoniques,” dedicated by the composer “to his friend W. 8S. Bennett,’”’ were excellently played by Miss Zimmermann; and, although rather “severe” for a concertroom, were warmly applauded. The vocalist was Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, who was enthusiastically encored in a graceful song by Miss Zimmermann, ‘‘ Only a year ago, love,” and also sang with much success two songs by Rubinstein.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1826-029.txt_p213': 'People are apt to quote “ the German school” as authority in these cases.
