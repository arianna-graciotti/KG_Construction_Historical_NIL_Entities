We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.'}

His choice seems to be singular, for he took Cimarosa’s duet, ‘ Se fiato in corpo avete,”’ which is written for iwo bases, with Catalani, his voice being a tenor. Humour however, and not singing, is his forte. His voice is fine, and his manner displays some few proofs of cultivation, but none of a desire to be estimated as a serious singer. His execution is often’ rough and abr upt, and he confines himself generally to comic compositions. “ Largo al fuctotum dellu citta is one of his favourites. He has since sung both these things at the Cambridge Festival. As an accompanist, he is powerful rather than judicious. “I do not know how he does it,”’ said a lady of quality, intending high commendation, “ but you would never suppose so much sound could proceed from one piano forte.”’ One of the most singular, yet most striking circumstances attending these as well as the public concerts, is the continual repetition of the very same pieces, night after night.

The first tenor part in all these later anthems lies high, and rather corresponds to a male alto part than to an ordinary tenor; indeed, in some cases, Handel has written the part in the alto clef. In the present work, more than in any other of these anthems, the composer used old material. The subject of the opening symphony is borrowed from the Ode for Queen Anne's Birthday, and the movement in the form in which we find it here is identical with the first movement of the third oboe concerto. The. commencement of the first chorus is taken from the Passion of Christ, and the phrase, ‘‘The heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works,” is nothing more than “the heavens and all the powers therein,” of the Utrecht “Te Deum.” The subject of the last chorus is also taken from the same work. The finest part of this anthem is the choral writing. The second chorus, “ Righteousness and equity,” is the best number, and seems to have furnished the composer with some suggestions for the chorus, ‘‘ Thou hast prevented him,” in the Coronation anthem, “ The king shall rejoice.” Excepting the trio, “‘Thou rulest the raging of the sea,” the solo pieces are not in Handel's best manner; and, on the whole, this will hardly be considered one of the finest anthems of the series."", 'able feeling. Sir Walter Scott appears in his usual energy and vigour. His ‘“ Maid of Isla” is a sweet and beautiful song. His “‘ Donald Caird” is the very perfection of humorous description; and his ‘t Pibroch of Dhonuil Dhu” is, perhaps, one of the most inspiring warcries that ever was uttered. "" The symphonies and accompaniments to the melodies owe their birth to the greatest masters that Germany can boast.

{'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p484': ""fugued choruses, “‘ In the voice of praise ” and “ Put thy trust in God.” 7. ‘* My song shall be alway.”—This is the first of the four-part anthems, containing, in the choruses, two tenor parts instead of one. The first tenor part in all these later anthems lies high, and rather corresponds to a male alto part than to an ordinary tenor; indeed, in some cases, Handel has written the part in the alto clef. In the present work, more than in any other of these anthems, the composer used old material. The subject of the opening symphony is borrowed from the Ode for Queen Anne's Birthday, and the movement in the form in which we find it here is identical with the first movement of the third oboe concerto. The. commencement of the first chorus is taken from the Passion of Christ, and the phrase, ‘‘The heavens shall praise Thy wondrous works,” is nothing more than “the heavens and all the powers therein,” of the Utrecht “Te Deum.” The subject of the last chorus is also taken from the same work. The finest part of this anthem is the choral writing. The second chorus, “ Righteousness and equity,” is the best number, and seems to have furnished the composer with some suggestions for the chorus, ‘‘ Thou hast prevented him,” in the Coronation anthem, “ The king shall rejoice.” Excepting the trio, “‘Thou rulest the raging of the sea,” the solo pieces are not in Handel's best manner; and, on the whole, this will hardly be considered one of the finest anthems of the series."", 'TheHarmonicon_1828-001.txt_p309': 'able feeling.

The two Scotch tenors have been rivals throughout life. Tney were conventicle clerks together in Edinburgh. Mr. Templeton was either a compositor or became connected in some way with the press. Mr. Wilson was a reader or corrector of the press, and in that capacity read or revised most of Sir Walter Scott’> works. Having fine voices, both somewhat late in life turned theatrical tenors, Wilson appearing at Covent-garden Theatre, and Templeton at Drurylane. The former, having a beautiful voice with out much science or style, gained a good position promptiy, although never regarded as a firstrate artist. Templeton made no way until the matchless Malibran awoke him into life in the “ Sonnambula.’? She Ialianized his Scotch style, animated his cold temperament, and he fairly took the town by storm. Subsequent studies in Puris under Bordogai, Balfe, and other masters, have improved him wonderfully, although he remains a very uncertain singer; and the distortion of his face whilst breathing forth melodious strains as a lover has been a great drawback on his reputation.'}

His brother, a very skilful organist at the cathedral of Clermont en Auvergne (which he was about to quit in order to settle at Dijon) offered him the reversion of his situation ; in order to accept this, he was obliged to sign an engagement for a long term.'}

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'The concertante went off remarkably well.

As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.']","Your task is to determine the occupation(s) of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.'}

The first fart of the programme consisted of selections from the works of Mendelssohn. Especial mention should be made of the hymn, “ Hear my prayer,” which was rendered to-perfection, the solos being effectively sung by Miss Julia Jones. The second part opened with Sterndale Bennett’s quartett, “God is a Spirit,"" sung by Miss Jones, Messrs. Bucknell, Twining, and Phillips, and encored.

W. hen Mr. Chorley first came before the public as an operatic critic, the Italian Opera was siniply a grand display of song; the singers were all in al’, the band was of small importance, and the scenery a mere thing of shreds and patches.

Occasionally he is somewhat too dogmatic. ; more rarely his manner verges on the supercilious. ‘Mr. Chorley generally ignores the church, and his: musical standpoint is therefore the opera. His writings are chiefly .histerical notes upon the progress “of the operatic, as seen in the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, and in the coneatenations of Meyerbeer, Berlioz, and Wagner. He takes credit for having at first sight: discerned the merits of Gounod, and he has uniformly pressed the works of this composer upon the attention of his readers. Many would not agree witheall that he has written upon Gounod; but he prophesied the success of the Faust, and as his prophecy was fulfilled, he has, so far, the best of\'the argument. W. hen Mr. Chorley first came before the public as an operatic critic, the Italian Opera was siniply a grand display of song; the singers were all in al’, the band was of small importance, and the scenery a mere thing of shreds and patches. Pasta and Malibran, Ru- bini and Lablache, cared nothing ‘for scenery""; and two fiddles and a bass would have been quite etiough for.all their wants in the way of -aceompaniment.

The nmusic possesses much that is of a superior character, but unfortunately the poet had furnished them with but few situations of interest, and few opportunities for concerted pieces. Beyond chorusses, airs, and couplets, nothing was given them to set to music; and yet, several of these couplets are delightfully rendered. An air sung by Leon, with a chorus accompaniment, and another to the words Si j’étais Roi, were warmly encored.'}

Question: ""What is the occupation of Edward Ascough?""

Answer:","The sentence does not provide a clear occupation for Edward Ascough; occupation unknown

Explanation: The sentence mentions that Edward Ascough's will was preserved in the archives of Magdalen College, Oxford, and his place of residence. However, there is no information specifying his occupation. Words such as ""an inveterate punster"" and ""a great musiciant"" are referred to people associated with Cambridge, not Edward Ascough from the given sentence.
