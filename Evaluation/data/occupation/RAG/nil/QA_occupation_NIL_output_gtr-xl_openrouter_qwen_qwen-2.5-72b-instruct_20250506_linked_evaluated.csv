The truth is that every day fresh improvements are made as fresh minds are turned to the subject, or rather perhaps as experience discovers shorter roads or more minute details. We conceive Mr. Burrowes has drawn his lights from experience, and his mind appears to be one naturally studious of inethod and capable of arrangement.

He is already arrived at some eminence in his profession; and the best judges predict of him a reputation seareely inferior to that of his great prototype. ‘There is at Milan an excellent performer on the flute, named Rabboni. Signor Rabboni’s style is bold, free, and firm, but deficient in the exquisite polish which distinguishes the execution of Mr. Drouet.” Thus our author seems to have exhausted the subject, and t to have enumerated most if not all of the distinguished players in Europe. M. Fiirstenau is however an addition. ‘This gentleman has but lately arrived from Germany. His execution is brilliant, but his tone is thin. Indeed all the foreign performers are thrown back in comparison with our own Nicholson in this grand respect, The reader will perceive, by the copious extracts we have made, how interesting we deem Mr. James’ work to be.. But we are to assure the amateur of the flute, that far more of moment remains behind, for which we refer him to the book itself, which is a specimen of how much amusement and instruction may be combined by knowledge and zeal, for with writing as an art Mr. James is obee 9 cy \x0c 64 “JAMES ON THE FLUTE.', 'of living violinists; which, however, makes us the more wonder at the silence with which he receives the singularly equivocal accusation made against him by his celebrated competitor Ernst. This silence is unworthy of M. Sivori, and such of his friends as have recommended him thereto have been sadly at fault in their recommendation. MM. Ernst accuses M. Sivori of what, at the mildest, must be termed piracy; and M. Sivori says not a word, either in refutation or extenuation of that of which he is accused. This is hardly what we ought to expect from one accomplished artist to another, and leaves, in our mind, an impression any thing but favourable to M. Sivori. This is the more disagreeable to us, as we openly profess ourselves friends and admirers of both parties; and though we must confess a preference for the style and execution of M. Ernst, whom we look upon as the greatest violinist since Paganini, yet we have so lofty an opinion of the abilities of M. Sivori, that we are painfully jealous of his good name.

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers.

T..', ""Tus very interesting little work. is, to the best of our belief, new alike in idea and execution. Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7.""]","Your task is to determine the occupation(s) of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

T..', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p662': ""Tus very interesting little work. is, to the best of our belief, new alike in idea and execution. Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7.""}

Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p766': 'Lenton, and C.

His feeling as an artist is completely shown by the care he bestows on the making-up of his characters. ‘There is no actor on the English stage who so utterly gives up his identity as this Italian vocalist. Take him in the first act of Belisario, and in Linda di Chamouni, or La Gazza Ladra, and you will find a difficulty in believing him to be the same Fornasari; you will look once more to your bill to see if you have not been mistaken. Strange to say, one of his detractors found occasion in the course of the season, to remark that he ‘‘ over-dressed” one of the characters! What could the artist think of this charge! Had he sacrificed his identity too much ? Had he been rather too good? Some have said, that he has not made a sensation equal to that which he made in Belisario at the beginning of the season. If this be true—what then! Belisario like Torquato Tasso, is one of those “ starring” operas that are simply made to bring forward the baritone singer, and no opera of the sort has been played since; but Fornasari has one through the ordinary routine. ‘Taking this into consideration, none can say with justice that his success in La Gazza Ladra and in Linda hos not been proportionably as great as in Belisario.', 'The scenery is excellent. The artist’s forte, we think, is architectural design; and we have noticed that Italian scene-painters generally excel in that department. This is an opera which will afford the professor profitable amusement, and the well-informed amateur delight; but we have an unpleasant, lurking suspicion, that it savours more of the olive than the honey; and, therefore, may not be so readily swallowed as some other operas; at least we fear that the ‘most respectable public,” as the manager ‘terms them, will prove our suspicion just, and we are sure that they ought not todo so.

His feeling as an artist is completely shown by the care he bestows on the making-up of his characters. ‘There is no actor on the English stage who so utterly gives up his identity as this Italian vocalist. Take him in the first act of Belisario, and in Linda di Chamouni, or La Gazza Ladra, and you will find a difficulty in believing him to be the same Fornasari; you will look once more to your bill to see if you have not been mistaken. Strange to say, one of his detractors found occasion in the course of the season, to remark that he ‘‘ over-dressed” one of the characters! What could the artist think of this charge! Had he sacrificed his identity too much ? Had he been rather too good? Some have said, that he has not made a sensation equal to that which he made in Belisario at the beginning of the season. If this be true—what then! Belisario like Torquato Tasso, is one of those “ starring” operas that are simply made to bring forward the baritone singer, and no opera of the sort has been played since; but Fornasari has one through the ordinary routine. ‘Taking this into consideration, none can say with justice that his success in La Gazza Ladra and in Linda hos not been proportionably as great as in Belisario.', 'TheHarmonicon_1833-005.txt_p573': 'The scenery is excellent.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work.

A recitative and air, “The soft southern breeze,” from Barnby’s “ Rebekah,” was exquisitely sung by Mr. Stedman, and Mr. Vernon Linley gave “Is not His word like a fire,” from “Elijah,” and Gounod’s “ Nazareth,” with a power which time and experience will farther develop.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1843-029.txt_p106': 'Miss Farmer’s playing was characterised by much brilliancy and precision, and the selection of music was creditable to her taste and judgment. John Parry was as amusing as usual in his “ Sleeping Beauty ;” and solos on the flute and concertina were respectively played by Mr. Richardson and Signor Regondi. Miss J. Farmer, a younger sister of the pianist, sang “The deep, deep sea” in a voice which, with time and cultivation, may ripen into a fine contralto. ‘The room was crowded in every part.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p18': 'Miss Marshall delighted us by her fine execution of “ Non Temer,” in which she proved herself the accomplished and imaginative singer we have so often pronounced her.—The accompaniment to this very difficult cantata was achieved by Mr. Dorrell in brilliant and masterly style—It was loudly applauded.—Spohr’s charming duet was beautifully sung by Miss Marshall and Mr. Calkin, and well received.—The three exquisite morceaux selected by Mr. Bennett from his own works, each of which is a perfectly finished miniature, went home to all hearts and produced a deep sensation. We must confess (if we are to be hypercritical) that we should have preferred all three of them a shade slower; but Mr. Bennett may be supposed the best judge of the manner in which his own compositions should be rendered, and therefore our solitary grumble will not have much weight.—We half excused him with the notion that he was preparing himself for the \x0c THE MUSICAL WORLD.'}

Mr. Steed, although a conscientious artist, is evidently not a musical fanatic, for he wisely commences his address by ing upon his hearers the necessity of enlarging the mind by a study of all arts, in order to work reverently and seriously in any one. “ Not long ago,” he says “ Mr. Ella tells us, at a discussion upon Musical Education at the Society of Arts, painter, a Royal Academician, who had received_his education gratuitously, repudiated the idea of State aid for music on the ground that it was not worthy of being called an art at all. This want of comprehensiveness in those who are considered to belong to the educated classes was doubtless the cause of Channing's pregnant query, ‘Did you ever know a senior wrangler who wasn’t a fool?’ which conveys the incontrovertible truth that exclusive or undue devotion to any kind of study, however legitimate or beneficial, cannot but cramp the powers of the intellect and narrow the sympathies of the mind.” This is indeed true; and were it not for the firm belief a real lover of his art has in what Mr. Steed calls the “moral influence” of muzic, the chance would be small of ita eventually making its way through the mist of ignorance which surrounds it. Pursuing his subject logically, illustrating his positions with much acuteness, and occasionally in most felicitous language, our author very ably proves that music is of all arts most spontaneous, the germs of vocal music, indeed, being inseparable from articulation. “I must repeat,” he says, “that while the organs for the production of effects upon the ear are innate to man, he has to go out of himself, as it were, to obtain the means of appealing tothe eye. Poetry and vocal music are born with him ; architecture, painting and sculpture, can only be practised when he has found out the use of tools.” We regret that we have not space to follow Mr. Steed through the principal points of his very able lecture, but we cannot refrain from quoting some of his remarks respecting those who should be employed. as instructors of youthful pupils, because we are certain that so much misapprehension exists upon this matter that the sooner the truth is spoken the better. “The custom,” he says, “of having incompetent teachers for the young, in the hope that a more capable and expensive one will be able to put things right by and by, is another frequent cause for want of success. The rudiments ofthe art, unless correctly acquired at first, are rarely learnt at all. A bad position of the hands, and numberless other faults, if long persisted in, \x0c will stick to a pupil in spite of all the efforts of after years.” And, speaking of eminent solo performers being engaged as ‘ he writes thus :—“ Great players, independently of their disinclination, are seldom possessed of the requisite qualifications for jeaching beginners of only average talent; _« « « they can hardly be expected to sacrifice the maintenance of their executive proficiency, and their study of the higher branches of the art, in order to make themselves acquainted with the best method of teaching children their notes, and of arousing their dormant sensibilities.” Pre«cisely; bat the delusion that-they will do so is so common that it will require many years to root it out, especially with those parents and guardians who are themselves utterly ignorant of the subject for which they seek instruction. Meanwhile, however, it is good that the question should be ventilated whenever an opportunity arises ; and Mr. Steed deserves every credit for the manner in which he hes boldly come forward to challenge this, as well as many othér conventional shams, connected with the art."", 'Miss Le Roy as harpist, and Mr. T.

The two principal choruses, ‘O that men wo praise the Lord” and “Thou, O Lord, art our Father,” were sung with vigour and precision, and also the chert &ccompanying the tenor air, “ Let us eat and drink.” The secon pat ‘was very brief, and consisted of a few sacred airs and anthems. A recitative and air, “The soft southern breeze,” from Barnby’s “ Rebekah,” was exquisitely sung by Mr. Stedman, and Mr. Vernon Linley gave “Is not His word like a fire,” from “Elijah,” and Gounod’s “ Nazareth,” with a power which time and experience will farther develop.']","Your task is to determine the occupation(s) of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

In the contralto solo, “Love not the world,’ Miss Marion Severn was also hi successful. But the chief burden of the solo portion of the work falls upon the tenor and baritone. . whose reputation is increasing steadily and surely, sang the tenor airs with a skill and feeling which left nothing to be desired, and, especially in the one beginning “ How many hired servants of my father’s,” deeply impressed the audience. Mr. Bridge’s excellent baritone voice was shown te advantage in the airs, “ Trust in the Lord” and “For this my son.” The duets for tenor and bass, “ Father, I have sinned ’’ and. ‘‘ My son is yet alive,” and the quartet, “ The Lord is nigh,” were most effective, and elicited much a plause. The two principal choruses, ‘O that men wo praise the Lord” and “Thou, O Lord, art our Father,” were sung with vigour and precision, and also the chert &ccompanying the tenor air, “ Let us eat and drink.” The secon pat ‘was very brief, and consisted of a few sacred airs and anthems. A recitative and air, “The soft southern breeze,” from Barnby’s “ Rebekah,” was exquisitely sung by Mr. Stedman, and Mr. Vernon Linley gave “Is not His word like a fire,” from “Elijah,” and Gounod’s “ Nazareth,” with a power which time and experience will farther develop.'}

It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p734': 'Great Grimsspy.—On Monday evening, the t4th ult., Mr. Oates; Macaulay-terrace, on behalf of the Great Grimsby Choral Society, presented Dr. Barry, the able conductor, with an ivory baton beauti: ully mounted with silver. Dr. Barry, in acknowledging the gift, said that he regarded it as an expression of unity and co-operation between the members of the choir and himself, and thanked the Society for so kind a mark of appreciation of his services. , Haxirax.—On the 3rd and 4th ult. two soirées were held in the Drill Hall to welcome the Rev. F. Pigou, M.A., chaplain in ordinary to the Queen, on his appointment to the vicarage of Halifax. The first soirée was especially for the poor connected with the several churches and charities in the town. An excellent programme was provided and well rendered. The soloists were Mrs, Eckersley, of Bradford, Miss Filling, Miss Empsall, and Messrs. Verney Binns, Carter, and Rickard. iss Thompson played several solos on the violin, and the Misses Warneford a duet on two grand pianofortes. The choir of the parish church was augmented by about fifty selected vocalists from the town, the result being some very excellent part-singing. The musical arrangements were under the direction of the organist and choirmaster of the parish church, Mr. J. V, Roberts, Mus, Bac. Oxon., who officiated as conductor and accompanist. .'}

The public enthusiasm redoubled at each representation, and it is but justice to acknowledge, that never was feeling better founded. Is it not surprising that a singer, whose mame was scarcely known here eighteen months ago, should have so suddenly raised herself to the first rank, and established her claim as the first dramatic singer of the day?

But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'The great passport to public favour, and it is as sudden in its exaltation of the fame of singers as ilis great in power, is the King’s Theatre—this has been frequently the subject of remark, but this season has confirmed it more than. ever with regard to the effect upon the Benefit Concerts. We are. warranted. in saying that even where the most’ extensive personal connection has seemed to favour the artist’s right to public patronage, the concerts have failed from the absence or the opposition of the leading stars of the opera.

Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson."", 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p842': 'The great passport to public favour, and it is as sudden in its exaltation of the fame of singers as ilis great in power, is the King’s Theatre—this has been frequently the subject of remark, but this season has confirmed it more than. ever with regard to the effect upon the Benefit Concerts.

Uf Handel’s operas he said that, ‘‘with the exception of a few exquisite airs and choruses, they have sunk into oblivion; and in spite of the great musical beauties they contain, the rich source of pare enjoyment and instruction: they present to the student, to revive them on the stage would prove a decided failure.” The second part of this’ lecture présented a thorough, réview of the life and’ labors of the writer Gluck, and his reform of musical-dramatie art, with interesting accounts of his relations with his literary and noble contemporaries, and of the famous Gluck and Piccini feud. In a summary of what had been s0 far accomplished on the various operatic stages of Europe, Mr. Ritter said : “The opera, as the highest meaning and expression of the musical -drama, is not the work of one nation.

Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form.

A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered. This work alone is sufficient to hand down Mr. Novello’s name as that of a man studied in the best schools, and as one whose understanding of his art has been cultivated far beyond the ""fortune ofthe many to attain. The terzettino from Winter, is very delightful music, and the Stabat Mater, from the rare MS. of Signor Fago, is a magnificent work. The air from Himmel is elegant; and ‘the quintet from ‘Mozart concludes the Number wor thily. ‘The chants and hymns are of a sober though elevated character. A selection of such general excellence can rarely be met with. oe Mr. Novello has, in the sixth book of evening services, made a ‘choice which is to be esteemed for the purity of the style and the gravity of the general character of the pieces.

A MS. ‘trio, from’ Caldara, full of erudite modulation, and a chorus and fugue from Paisiello conclude the book. The latter is spirited, fine, and masterly almost beyond example. , Mr. Novello has established a character for judgment in the se‘Jection and accuracy in the preparation of his materials that needs no additional commendation from us. He surmounts with uncom-_ mon tact the objection brought against such adaptations, that they may tend to lower devotional feelings by vulgar or light associations, for in all these three books are very few themes that ‘we recollect, while they are so admirably fitted to the words that it would be supposed they were all written as they now stand.

W. Statham, B.A., vicarof Ellesmere Port, near Chester, received from the University the degree of Doctor of Music. Dr. Statham is well known from his connection with the Choral Association of the Frodsham E. and W. Deaneries, and from hymn tunes and anthems which he has written. The honour of a musical doctorate has been but seldom granted by the University of Durham, one of the last to receive this distinction having been the late lamented Dr. Dykes. In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals.

As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.', ""At subsequent concerts on the 15th and 2znd ult., attractive programmes were provided and well rendered by Misses Sinclair and Russell, Mdme.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""]","Your task is to determine the occupation(s) of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

In Mr. Collet’s letter on the “‘ Macbeth” music, published in our last number, a printer’s error, in some portion- of our edition, has made him mention “ Mr. John Locke,’’ instead. of ‘* Mr. Tom Cooke,” as the composer of some music supplied for Mr. Macready’s revival of “ Acis and Galatea.” In paragraph 5, line 3, we may also say, the word “ lead ” should be substituted for “ leave.” THe author of a string quartett recently performed at a trial of new works by the Musical Artists’ Society, writes to us correcting a mistake in our notice last month, which he says is of “frequent occurrence” in other journals. It appears that there are two artists before the public whose ames are very similar, and that we have mentioned ““Lehmeyer” instead of “ Lahmeyer” as the composer of the quartett referred to. , Tue death of Mr. Edwin Ransford, at the age of 71, which occurred at his residence in Welbeck Street, on the 11th ult., deserves more than a passing record, for though but seldom before the public latterly, he was, in the old days of so-called ‘English Opera,” a favourite vocalist, singing for many seasons in the Covent Garden Company, under the successive managements of Charles Kemble, ‘Laporte, Bunn, Osbaldiston, Macready, and Madame Vestris. As an exponent of the songs of Dibdin, he was well known in the concert-room, and apart from his professional “merits, was universally esteemed as a genial and kindlyhearted man. The funeral, which took place in his native village, was, at his especial request, unattended by any but his sorrowing relatives and a few of his warmest old friends.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p718': ""At subsequent concerts on the 15th and 2znd ult., attractive programmes were provided and well rendered by Misses Sinclair and Russell, Mdme. Osborne Williams, Messrs. Wilford Morgan, Stedman, and J. L. Wadmore.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended. All this is very fair on the part of Mr. Wilson, and should serve az a le: son to his rival not to attempt an imposition like Mr. Templeton’s pretended melodies in ‘¢ Mary Queen of Scots.” For the rest, Mr. Wilson sings thirteen airs, two of which are old French melodies—“ Mary’s Farewell to France,” and ‘¢ The Last Lay of Chatelard;” the latter a most charm ing composition, and deliciously sung by Wilson.""}

That hero-worship should partially blind the judgment of those who consider themselves the elect is scarcely to be wondered at; but those who have preserved their freedom of thought are not to be ridden over by any art Juggernaut; and it is well that a protest should at once be made against a system which is aimed at the very root of free and independent criticism. Herr Rubinstein is a representative man, and with many faults has genius enough to command a hearing wherever he appears. Were his perfect mechanism and consummate mastery over every gradation of tone controlled by that reverence for his mission which places the art above the artist, he would be everything that his most earnest admirers claim for him; but when we find that many portions of the works he performs are simply used as vehicles for the display of the executant, and that his ‘new readings,” as they are termed, derive much of their novelty from their flatly contradicting the expressed intentions of the composer, we cannot but feel) that the wonder called forth by his playing is often created at the expense of the art, and that the eulogistic criticism of those who are carried away by his exaggerated style too much resembles: the praise of the courtier, who is not only in ecstacies with the virtues of his lord and master, but even in his vices sees something to admire.
