Earl Dudley, who had kindly granted the use of his house for the meeting, occupied the chair, and in presenting the testimonial made a most eloquent speech, in which he spoke in the highest terms of Sir Julius, and made many graceful allusions to the estimation he was held in by the most eminent artists, and the popularity obtained by his innumerable compositions, especially alluding to the honour conferred upon him by Her Majesty.

Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p799': 'Leader, Mr. Loder.-—Conduetor, Mr. Neate.'}

He is generally cited as the first and finest tenorin Rome. This artist was kind enough to enable us to hear, in a circle of chosen friends, some of his last vocal compositions. The delicacy and purity of his beautiful Italian music gave us unmixed delight. Simplicity and innocence are the dis‘tinguishing characteristics of his airs. They do not force so much as insinuate their way to the heart by their softness. They do not contain many new ideas, but they are well arranged and presented in an interesting manner. In a word Morroni proves that he possesses exquisite taste and great knowledge in the har- monic and technical branches of his art. We heard him at different times in concerts. He inspired his auditors with the sentiment his singing was intended to awaken. All breathed of love when he sang Haydn’s charming duet, “ Saper vorrei se mami.” But how can we describe the singing? How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings. His pure, mellifluous, full, and young voice; his moderation, which considering his powers, is astonishing ; his power of calculating the effect that certain inflexions will have on his hearers, give Morroni a superiority over all his rivals.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p362': '15.

Earl Dudley, who had kindly granted the use of his house for the meeting, occupied the chair, and in presenting the testimonial made a most eloquent speech, in which he spoke in the highest terms of Sir Julius, and made many graceful allusions to the estimation he was held in by the most eminent artists, and the popularity obtained by his innumerable compositions, especially alluding to the honour conferred upon him by Her Majesty.

Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires.

We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

He has proved that amongst a number of composers he was that one who developed with the greatest nicety’ each delicate and strong idea indicated by the author. If Ban‘donelli were as original, and rich in invention as he is happy in the choice of his melodies, he would acquire an immortal title to celebrity. The Preghiere a Dio; for three voices, are the most \x0c ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF MUSIC IN ROME. 33 beautiful of his works; they were published at Naples. Bandonelli passes a very retired life, and regrets in his philosophy the errors of his age, which he often chastises very poetically in his satires. His last unedited poem in the didactic style, “ Suila musica odierna,” contains so many passages full of talent, so many piquant and striking portraits of the composers of the day, that it merits richly the honor oftranslation. Sirletti, the pupil of Jan‘haconi, is a connoisseur pianiste and a composer. It is in the accompaniment of antient music that he displays all the force of his genius. The psalms of Marcello are his triumph. We have been present at several musical soirees at his house, and have always met distinguished singers and a seleet audience. We there heard again Signor Marconi Schoenberger. We were but 7 little disposed to like his base voice, which has always affected us disagreeably. Elere however he enchanted us in a tenor solo from Marcello’s twenty-eighth psalm. His whole soul seemed to be infused into his voice. Signor Gioannini’s tenor, and Sarti’s sonorous base voice, contributed not a little to the effect produced in the execution of these psalms. We particularly remarked _the twenty-third and twenty-sixth. His last, magnificent and inimitable for its truth and expression, is likewise remarkable for the triumph expressed. in the subject of its chorusses. But to return to Sirletti, it is as a piano forte composer that he is most distinguished; equality of style, vivacity and truth of universal expression, flowing and interesting melody, without useless difficulties, are the characteristics of his compositens. Would to Heaven that many composers who lose themselves in the clouds of mannerism and affectation, would imitate thewisdom of Sirletti, Asioli, and Pollini—we should not then so often regret the absence of fine and beautiful melody, and natural harmonies drawn from the purest source of art!

Its object will be best understood by the following extract from Professor Macfarren’s Preface :— “‘ Any isolated example of a chord, even with its resolution, if it be a discord, can give as little idea of its effect upon the sense or meaning of a musical phrase, as can a word in a column of a dictionary represent the spirit of a poetical passage in which it may occur. Analagous to the literary quotations with which lexicographers elucidate the meanings they expound, are designed to be these concise strains. It would have been easy to cite from the works of the great masters instances of every chord and every progression herein exemplified; but impossible to find complete phrases, in which some of the chords were not so surrounded by other matter that their distinction would have been troublesome for a learner. It is therefore, perhaps, best to the purpose, to have framed these original Sentences, which, in systematic order, display the entire subject. The author is happy to issue this publication as a confession of musical faith, avowing implicit belief in the harmonic theory on which it is based, and thorough conviction that the theory accounts for everything that is beautiful, and guards against what is ‘unsatisfactory in musical combination and progression.” , Though only recently published, we further learn from the preface that these sentences were written as long ago as 1867, at the request of Mr. Curwen, whose musical labours in connection with the Tonic Sol-Fa movement will be known to all our readers. As to the manner in which the plan of the work has beencarried out, there can hardly be two opinions. The author is well known as one of our profoundest theorists, and it is difficult to speak too highly of the often exceedingly felicitous, yet perfectly natural manner in which he has introduced the chords which his sentences illustrate. We quote one example, not because it is'the best, but because it does not require a long extract. In Exs. 7 and 8, we find the minor chord of the sub-dominant in a major key—in other words, the chromatic chord of the sub-dominant, first used in modulation, and then simply as a chromatic chord remaining in the same key. Both examples are identical as regards their first four bars, which contain only diatonic harmonies, and which, therefore, we need not quote. The author’s point is evidently to show that with the same chord we can modulate, or not, at pleasure. Commencing, then, with the fifth bar, Exs. 7 and 8, are as follow :-— Ex. 7.""]","Your task is to determine the occupation(s) of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre.

What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.'}

Answer:","organist


In the provided sentence, the context is related to the education of Mr. Moody at Bates, engaging with his possible career interests. The focused individual, Mr. Westlake Morgan, is referenced as the organist of Bangor Cathedral. Given how gently organists are woven into the narrative in other given contexts, and no direct mention of them pursuing other occupations, it is reasonable to assert that ""organist"" is Mr. Westlake Morgan's occupation.

Other occupations listed in the examples, such as choirmaster, conductor, or chamber musician, are not suggested in this sentence.

In London he made his debit at Salomon’s Concerts, where in a concerto of his own composition he excited no less admiration than he had previously gained In the years 1794 and 1795 Mr. Viotti had some share in the management of the King’s Theatre. Shortly after this he succeeded Mr. Wm.

Princes, and a long list of grandees and ladies of distinction were invited. “ It is now a long time,” said Viotti, “ since we descended to them ; they must ow ascend to us.” Mr. Viotti had a turn for repartee. One day when the minister Calonne, asked him which violin was the most true,—“ That,” replied he with a significant look, ‘* which is the least false.” : M. Puppo, whose talents upon the violin were great, and which Mr. Viotti was the first to praise, was fond of hoasting that he was a scholar of the great Tartini, which was known not to be the case. On a public occasion, when M. Lahoussaye, who was really a disciple of Tartini, was present, Viotti begged him as a favour to give him a specimen of Tartini’s manner of playing; *“and now,” said he in a voice loud enough to be heard by all the company, “now M.

The wind instruments were delicious ; the names of Ribas, Laza rus, Jarrett, and Baumann, were a sufficient guarantee for this. The quintet of Onslow, went to perfection. We like the playing of Mr. Goffrie (second violin) so much, that we must affirm we should be greatly pleased to hear himtake the primo violino, for once in a way—and we are sure an enthusiastic lover of his art like Mr. Willy, would not object to play second to him, just to give him a chance. The vocal music was scarcely so good as usual—with the exception of the scena of Miss Rainforth. Mr. Moscheles presided admirably at the pianoforte. Mr. Bennett sang, instead of Mozart’s song, a ballad, in G minor, by Mendelssohn.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1876-402.txt_p506': 'Mr. WatTerR MACFARREN gave a Morning Concert at St. James’s Hall on the ist ult., before a highly appreciative audience.

His “ Suite de Piéces,” already most favourably mentioned in our reviewing columns, and the Second Sonata for pianoforte and violin, which we hope shortly to notice at length, were exceedingly well rendered and warmly applauded, the valuable services of M. Sainton being secured for the latter work. The programme also included Mozart’s Trio in E flat, for piano‘forte, clarionet, and viola, Mendelssohn’s pianoforte Duet “*¢ Allegro Brillante” (Op. 92), in which Miss Kate Steel ably assisted her master, and Sterndale Bennett’s Sestet in F sharp minor, which with the concert giver at the pianoforte, and the stringed instruments in the hands of the artists already named, it is needless to say, went to perfection.
