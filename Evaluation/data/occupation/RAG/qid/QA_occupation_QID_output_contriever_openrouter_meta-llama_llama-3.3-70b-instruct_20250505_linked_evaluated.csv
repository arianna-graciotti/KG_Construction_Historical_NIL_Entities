His debut, however, at the Concert Spirituel, in the first concerto of his master, was by no means successful ; but not discouraged by this failure, he shortly after performed his concerto in A major, in which he gained great applause. For ten years Jarnowick was in great favour with the public. The charactéristics of his style were purity, precision, and elegance, but he failed in producing a vigorous tone, in sensibility of expression, und above all, in his cadences. Being obliged to quit France, Jarnowick was succeeded by Viotti, whose superior talents soon completely eclipsed those of his predecessor. Jarnowick was engaged as leader at the chapel of the Prince Royal of Prussia. He published at Paris seven symphonies and nine concertos for his instrument. 'Two amusing anecdotes are related of him. Being at Lyons, he announced a concert at six francs."", 'TheHarmonicon_1824-016.txt_p6': 'So rapid was the progress he made under his distinguished master, the celebrated Pugnani, that at the age of twenty, he was chosen to fill the situation of first violinist to the Royal Chapel of Turin.

At this period, Jarnowick was the great object of public attention, and excited universal admiration by his concertos, which were full of beauty: but Viotti soon eclipsed bis fame, as well by the elegance and grandeur of his compositions, as by the noble and powerful manner in which he executed them.
