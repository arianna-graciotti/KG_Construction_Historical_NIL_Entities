Question: ""What is the occupation of Mendelssohn?""

Answer:","composer; pianist; conductor; organist; music director

The person ""Mendelssohn"" is mentioned in the sentence provided in relation to a piece of music, specifically a ""Fugue"". Mendelssohn is a renowned composer, and in this context, it is highly likely that the reference to his work is in relation to his compositional output. Additionally, given that the piece is a ""Fugue"", it suggests that the reference is to Mendelssohn's prowess as a keyboardist, since fugues are often written for keyboard instruments. Mendelssohn was a skilled pianist and organist, and he often performed his own works in concerts. He also served as a music director and conductor, leading orchestras and choirs in performances of his own compositions and works by other composers. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that Mendelssohn's occupation was that of a composer, pianist, conductor, organist, and music director.",Q46096,person,Q36180;Q36834;Q158852;Q486748;Q765778;Q1028181;Q1622272;Q14915627;Q16145150,,0,0,0,1,QID,0,0.7747093023255814,0.6263219741480611,0.6926575698505523

Sentence: ""The next is a solo for an alto, anda quartet from Naumann.""
Question: ""What is the occupation of Naumann?""

Answer:","composer; musician; kapellmeister; conductor; singer; instrumentalist; impresario

Here's the reasoning:
- The sentence states that there is a ""quartet from Naumann,"" which implies that Naumann is a composer.
- The word ""quartet"" also implies that Naumann is a musician, as he has written music for a group of musicians.
- In the 18th and 19th centuries, the German term ""kapellmeister"" referred to a leader of a musical ensemble, typically an orchestra or choir, so Naumann is also a kapellmeister.
- As a kapellmeister, conductor is another appropriate job title for Naumann.
- Additionally, since Naumann has written music for an alto and quartet, it can be inferred that he is a singer and instrumentalist.
- Finally, Naumann may also have been an impresario, as he was a notable figure in the musical world of his time.",Q213927,person,Q36834;Q158852,,0,0,0,1,QID,0,0.7747093023255814,0.6263219741480611,0.6926575698505523
