{'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p606': 'The pieces are a quartet and chorus from Haydn, a base solo and quartet from Himmel, a trio from Cherubini, a duet for tenor _..and base from a MS. of Naumann, a quartet from the Benedictus of Huminel’s first mass, a quartet and chorus of Andreas Romberg, a quartet, from a rare MS. of Bonelli, and a Tantum ergo and chorus by Mr: Novello. The general character of this number is more ecclesiastical than that of the former—there is more science and less melody. Hadyn’s quartet and Himmel’s base solo—the duet from Naumann, and Mr. Novello’s compositions, are the lightest and most agreeable, but the rest have gravity and learning—well worth preservation in such a form. If the learned Editor has been less successful in the last book of his motets, he has been even more than usually happy in the fifth of his evening services, which is remarkable for the beauty of the whole, and for the very pleasing, elegant, and expressive nature of the pieces throughout the entire book. ‘The Regina Cali, acom- position from Mr. Novello’s hand, can hardly be too highly com. mended, whether the sweetness of the air intermingled with the chorus, the general contrivanc2 or the arrangement of the parts be considered.

If, too, his cantatasa—' From rosy bowers,’ and ‘Mad Bess,’ for instance—be cumpared with compositions in a degree similar by Alessandro Scarlatti, which have been so highly praised and so long were vaunted, the vast superiority of the English musician, whether as relates to air, to harmony, to propriety of expression, or to beauty of effect, will never be disputed by unbiassed judges.

Perhaps immediately after Mendelssohn, Spohr may take his place as a living composer—though great mannerism and repeated imitations of himself, almost unfit him for a station among such a glorious company. The predominant feature of Spohr’s music is a voluptuous monotony—a luxury indeed, but a vicious one. Oratorio, opera, sinfonia, concerto, quartet, to Spohr are all alike—one and the same thing, with regard to style—no shadow of distinction in character or in the march of thought—like a tide which ever flows—never ebbs.

The first public result. appears to have been the engagement of Carl Maria Von Weber to support by his presence in England the reputation he had already gained. a ‘The piece he was to work upon was drawn from the poetical visions of one of the most inspired of his own countrymen, Wieland—the time, the proudest.age of chivalry. Its machinery embraces the spirits « of air, earth, fire, and ocean, while the rapid specimens might be traced out with similar s success amongst the works of the composers pf all ‘countries and all ages—so intense is the working of theima‘gination when directed towards the visionary creations that seem to awaken all the powers to their utmost stretch of energy. But at the same time it will be seen by what totally different means these composers and Weber wrought their purposes. . .', 'Mozart was not liberal with his money only, but with his genius as well.

H. Franz, entitled ‘““ Der WArwolf,” ithe words by Paul Frohberg) is looked upon as an event of considerable importance in those musical circles of the northern capital where the reformatory ideas of Richard Wagner are favourably received, The work in question had to be produced under the same disadvantages against which the operatic music of the composer of ‘‘ Lohengrin”? had, until very recently, to contend in this country; the performance took place in the concert-room, and, by being thus divested of the dramatic action and stage surroundings, those elements were wanting which ought to be inseparably connected with the music of the modern “ art-work.”’ Such at least is the theory of its founder, and, as applied to his own opera-dramas, it is undoubtedly true. Looking however, at the subject of Franz’s Opera and the dramatic action it indicates, we begin to doubt whether the absence of the latter, as in the present case, would not, in some parts at least, be rather an advantage to the music than otherwise. The following is the plot (we are quoting the International Gazette of April the 24th) :—* ‘Der Warwolf’ is laid in the time of the thirty years’ war. The beast itself had the misfortune of being a wolf by night, and a man by day instead of a wolf all the time; and he is also endowed with certain magical powers. One of these was represented by a magic ring, which comes into possession of Merode a trooper under Tilly.

{'TheMusicalTimes_1875-388.txt_p430': 'T. H. Franz, entitled ‘““ Der WArwolf,” ithe words by Paul Frohberg) is looked upon as an event of considerable importance in those musical circles of the northern capital where the reformatory ideas of Richard Wagner are favourably received, The work in question had to be produced under the same disadvantages against which the operatic music of the composer of ‘‘ Lohengrin”? had, until very recently, to contend in this country; the performance took place in the concert-room, and, by being thus divested of the dramatic action and stage surroundings, those elements were wanting which ought to be inseparably connected with the music of the modern “ art-work.”’ Such at least is the theory of its founder, and, as applied to his own opera-dramas, it is undoubtedly true. Looking however, at the subject of Franz’s Opera and the dramatic action it indicates, we begin to doubt whether the absence of the latter, as in the present case, would not, in some parts at least, be rather an advantage to the music than otherwise. The following is the plot (we are quoting the International Gazette of April the 24th) :—* ‘Der Warwolf’ is laid in the time of the thirty years’ war. The beast itself had the misfortune of being a wolf by night, and a man by day instead of a wolf all the time; and he is also endowed with certain magical powers.

For-.after the extraordinary praise lavished upon her, a prejudice has beencreated, which we really believe has even been unfavourable to her in this country—so much did her eulogists teach usto expect.
