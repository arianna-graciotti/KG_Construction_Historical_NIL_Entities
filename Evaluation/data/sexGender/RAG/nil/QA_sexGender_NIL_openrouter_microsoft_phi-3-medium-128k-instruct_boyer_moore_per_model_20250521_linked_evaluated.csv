Question: ""What is the sex or gender of Clifton?""

Answer:","male

Since the sentence ""Clifton’s Compositions"" does not provide any direct indication of Clifton's gender, it is impossible to determine the gender with certainty without additional context.

Although ""Clifton’s Compositions"" is most likely referring to the book, there is no clear information available in the sentence. The name Clifton is usually used as a first name for males. However, without clear context, it's not conclusive.

Upon further research, it is safe to assume Clifton:
