They were both set to music by Hasse, who ranked high in the favour of the poet as a composer and as a man of genius. His correspondence with the celebrated Farinelli began in 1747. Many of. the poet’s letters, breathing affection and confidence, were written to the ‘great singer at Madrid, where, for two. successive reigns, he enjoyed the greatest favour. The blessings of peace, after a seven years’ war, produced the opera Il Re Pastore; this was followed by L’Eroe Cinese. In 1756, at the request of Farinelli, he wrote for the court of Spain an opera, Niéteti, which, under the direction of Farinelli, was played with the utmost splendour. The three last operas written by Metastasio were, Il Trionfo di Clelia, in 1762; Romolo ed Erstlia, in 1765; and Il Ruggiero, 1771: the first was performed at Vienna, on the delivery of Isabella, first wife of the Emperor Joseph IT. ; the second at Inspruck, on the marriage of the grand Duke of Tuscany with Maria, infanta of Spain; and the last at Milan, on the nuptials of the Archduke Ferdinand, with the Princess of Modena; and this finished the dramatic labours of the bard. His other poetical works, which are very numerous, are all replete with elegance, and every beauty of numbers which the language of Italy so sweetly supplies. Of his prose writings, the extracts from Aristotle's Poetics, and the Ars Poetica of Horace, are the principal. In all his writings the principles of religion and morality are all so chastely preserved, that the extreme of delicacy, the utmost vein: of prudery cannot find a sentiment to offend or alarm; and his private life corresponded well with his writings, as he was always found prompt to discourage all tendency to license, to show himself the avowed enemy of disrespect to the ordinances of morality and religion.

Rossini worked with the brush of a scene-painter in his Overture to Guillaume Tell and in the representations of a storm that divide the action of the second act in the Barbiere, Matilda di Shabran, and other of his comic Operas. Spohr evinced his descriptive power in his Symphonies, the Consecration of Sound, the Contention between Earthliness and Godliness in the soul of man, and the Seasons, and in his Overture to Azor and Zemira, representing the storm, the wreck of the merchant’s vessel, and his magical rescue. Weber’s Concert Stiick tells a complete story of anxiety in absence, a knight’s return, his true love’s eager rush to meet him, and their rapture in each other’s embrace. The success of Mendelssohn has been equal to that of the best of them in his Overtures, and in his Reformation Symphony and in those two orchestral works recording his impressions in Scotland and in Italy. The tone-pictures by Sterndale Bennett, namely, the Naiades, the Wood-Nymphs, and Paradise and the Peri, are each a masterpiece. Latest, if not last, the Abbé Liszt and Herr Raff are writing symphonic poems and Symphonies without the assumption of poetry, purposing to paint in tones the pictures announced in the titles they choose.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p305': ""take place monthly during the winter. -'They have the orchestra and singers from the royal theatre ; here we heard the instrumental music of Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn very well performed, as likewise some little duets of Cherubini’s and a trio of Paer’s, .""}

He at first attempted the violoncello,, but he soon laid that aside for the violin, on which he attained a great proficiency. He was chosen ‘to teach his instrument to the Dauphin, the father.of Louis XIV. In 1741.', 'Up to the period we have now reached, no absolute school for the violin had been established in France. Lully, although he was the first violinist of his day, had neither given up sufficient time in the latter part of his life to performance, nor did: he leave pupils behind him to propagate his style ; consequently it may be said almost to have died with its author, whilst Guignon and Leclair seem neither of them to have displayed sufficient genius in their compositions to have made any lasting impression on musical taste.

The syllable ‘wand’. was represented by the Pyramus and Thisbe wall-scene from the ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ;’ for ‘haus’ Charlotte (Mrs. Moscheles) acted a scene she had written herself, in which she is discovered knitting a blue stocking, and soliloquizing on the foibles of female authoresses, advising them to attend to their domestic duties.', 'TheHarmonicon_1828-001.txt_p269': 'At the same time, I hereby declare you the joint heirs of the little property, if so it can be called, which I have been able to lay up; share it equally and justly; live in harmony together, and assist each other. Whatever vou may have done against me, be assured that it has long since been forgiven. I thank you, in particular, my dear brother Carl, for the affectionate attentions I have experienced from you of late. It is my sincere hope and wish that you may lead a life more free from cares and sorrows than mine has been ; teach your children to love virtue; she alone, and not perishable gold, can make them truly happy. I speak it feelingly, and from experience 5 her hand it was that upheld me in the midst of the ills of life. To her influence, next to that of my art, do I owe the blessing of not having terminated my existence by suicide. Live morally, and love one another.'}

Was there a feeling in the mind of the composer that when the divine peace was granted there was cause for thankfulness on the part of the recipient, and did Bach intend to convey this idea musically? The stately ecclesiastical style of this final fugue is certainly more suited to the text than given. recently at St. James’s some of the settings to be met with in the Masses of other composers, which are so lively as to suggest the idea that the worshippers are exceedingly glad to get out of church.

Lemmens has taken as his models the solid compositions of the German school of organ-playing, rather than the light, not to say frivolous, French style so much in favour with some writers, and of which the organ works of Lefébure-Wély, and Batiste are examples. Even where M. Lemmens adopts the modern style—as, for instance, in the middle of the opening movement of the first sonata, where chords for the vox humana are accompanied by the 8-feet flute in the great—he does not degenerate into mere prettiness ; his music is always dignified. The slow movements in all the three sonatas are excellent; but the composer’s special partiality would seem to be for the fugal style. Each sonata contains at least one fugue, and the second hastwo. Tosay that some of these, though very cleverly written, have a suspicion of dryness is no reproach to the composer, because the art of writing a fugue which shall be as interesting as it is ingenious is one of the rarest of musical qualifications. The names “O filii” and ‘« Pascale,” given to the second and third sonatas, refer to the old Latin. hymns “O filii et filie’ and “ Victime paschali,” which are introduced, in the former into the slow movement and in the latter into the finale of the works.', 'TheHarmonicon_1824-016.txt_p69': 'Sir, . : ~.

At the Abbey meetings in Lenion, in 1784, &c. where. the musical force was ¢on- centrated, the profits amounted to above half of the receipts; and’ at the Yorkshire festival, where 5-11th of the gross receipts wereappropriated to charity, much aid was obtained at a moderate rate, from some of the choral societies just mentioned, and others in the West Riding ; whilst at Edinburgh, where a. vigorous effort was _ made in 1815 to rouse the national spirit, and lay the foundation of a real taste for music, so great were the expences, from the total want of chorus singers, and the necessity of bringing nearly all the performers from. England, that under the most splendid patronage, and with £5735 receipts, only £°1500, or rather more \x0c YORK FESTIVAL. 29 than 1-4th, was obtained for charitable purposes. If a good choral society for practice, were now formed in every large town in this large county, the next Yorkshire festival might not unreasonably be expected to surpass every performance that has yet taken place. We have to add, with great satisfaction, that societies of this description have been recently established at York and Hull, and we hope also that it has been the case at many other towns.” In connection with this part of the subject, and as illustrating ulterior benefits to be derived from the establishment of musical societies, not at all anticipated in their first establishment, as well _as conveying information concerning a very important, numerous, and respectable association of talent, we shall quote the relation given of the Yorkshire amateur meetings. Indeed we have for some time been preparing ‘to give a complete account of this ‘society, but Mr. Crosse has in some degree anticipated our design.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1873-366.txt_p602': 'successfully draws out the musical intelligence and feeling of choire—: at least-of Yorkshire choirs. The novelty of this series of tinal services has been the introduction of the old two-part anthem small “ places where they sing,"" ina modern form. Every one who \x0c had to do with small choirs knows full well the utter impossibility obtaining a balance of four-part register. Altos are well-nigh ‘gaknown things—their places being generally supplied—if supplied at all—by withdrawirg from the trebles the most reliable and useful ‘yoices, thus destroying the substance and self-reliance of the first sat without supplying an adequate second. The distinctive notes the tenor are scarcely ever to be heard in smal! choirs for the ‘gimple reason that those distinctive notes can only be produced by wry far more practice and care than the small-choir singer can to devote to his vocalization. The working compass of the ordi small choir resolves itself into from about C to E for boys, sis and women, and the lower from C to E for the men. For these two sets of voices has Mr. G. A. Macfarren—always ready as he is to ggeet areal church musical want when set beforehim - composed some . ‘two-part anthem two of which “ Blessed is the soul,” and “ Come ye ad let us go up,” have been sung at these choral gatherings. At first ofcourse the country choirs were hurt at the indignity of being reduced to two-part harmony, especially thdse that had no alto of any wort, and. whose third bass generally sang the tenor; but as festival after festival came round, one and all joined in heartiest praise of ‘what originally they had looked upon with disdainful eye. It was found in practice that far firmer singing, far purer tone, far truer ar ion, in fact far more real music, could be got out of the balanced $wo parts than out of the incomplete attempts at four-part anthems.', 'TheMusicalTimes_1875-388.txt_p426': 'materials, we have nothing left but praise. The ‘Agnus Dei” is a perfect gem. The theme, commenced in octaves by the two soprani, and afterwards joined by the chorus, then given in the minor by the solo voices, and harmonised in the instrumentation, came as a veritable inspiration upon the audience, and at its conclusion the applause could scarcely be subdued, even by..the repetition of the movement. Beautiful also is the ‘“ Lachrymosa,” the effect of the plaintive notes of the mezzo-soprano against the bass solo, giving a depth of expression to the words almost in..describable, These two movements are perhaps amongst the purest specimens of spontaneous writing in the work; but we must also instance the “ Recordare,” the bass-solo “Confutatis” (although we can scarcely reconcile ourselves to the sequence of fifths which accompanies it), and the final “ Libera me;”” but in naming these we need scarcely say that they comprise only a small portion of the many charming pieces in a composition which cannot fail to take a permanent place amongst the accepted works of modern composers. The solo parts were admirably sustained by Madame Stolz, Madame Waldmann, ‘Signor Masini, and Signor Medini, the first named lady displaying a clear and liquid soprano voice, eminently suited to give the utmost effect to Signor Verdi’s music. Madame Wald‘mann was also in every respect highly satisfactory, and both tenor and bass acquitted themselves of their arduous task most successfully, Signor Masini, however, occasionally indulging in a tremolo which much detracted from the effect of his really beautiful voice. The choruses were finely sung by the Royal Albert Hall Choir (which had been previously well drilled by Mr. Barnby), and the orchestra was everything that could be desired. Signor Verdi, who conducted, received quite an ovation, and was evidently much pleased with the manner in which his music had been prepared.

How express by words the delicious sensations he produces. What appears to give him a greater charm is, that he only sings his own compositions which ~accord with his style. He is always sure of victory in pieces _where he can display the delicacy of his expression and the acuteness of his feelings.

The opening is very pretty, and the whole very effective. It contains solo, duet, and trio, till it closes in a chorus.', 'All the salient points of this extraordinary man are touched upon vividly and delicately; his early aspirings, his warm nationality, his loves, his difficulties, and all the phases of his life, are feelingly and naturally portrayed.

Not one single word of any rubric nts at the existence of such a thing; in fact, rsions of the “ Veni Creator,” in the Ordination vice, are the only representatives of hymnody in ayer-book. And if we look at the title-pages of earlier psalters, though some do say of the tunes they are “sung in churches,” others give as purpose “for the encrease of virtue and yng of other vayne and triflyng ballads, to use of the Godly Christians recreating themin stede of fond and unseemly ballades,” and in fact, for fome rather than Church use.'}

Then there is the Capriccio by Bach for the harpsichord, written in 1704, representing the dissuasion of a beloved brother from a hazardous journey, his resistance of the same, and his departure, and concluding with a fugue on the notes of the postboy’s horn; and what can be more modern in purpose than this, more descriptive, or more programmatical? There are the same composer’s Pastoral Symphony in his Christmas Oratorio, and Handel’s piece of the same name in his Messiah, both figuring the shepherds at watch in the bright starlight on the night of the Nativity. There is the Symphony in Samson, to represent the falling of the building overthrown by the miraculous strength of the blind hero—almost the single instance of Handel’s use of chromatic passing notes—and that in Belshazzar, which is quaintly, but characteristically marked “ Allegro postillions,” to accompany the supposed hurried entrance of the throng of wise men summoned to interpret the prophetic writing on the wall; and need one look in the works of any age for a truer image of the feeling prevalent among the dramatic persons than the Dead March in Saul or the Jubilant March in Judas Maccabzus ? Haydn’s representation of the earthquake in his Seven Last Words, and of chaos in his Creation, bring the art of descriptive instrumental music a generation nearer to our own age. Even Beethoven, the accredited inventor of the practice, was forestalled by a few years in his design of the Sinfonia Pastorale, the earlier conception of pourtraying pastcral life in orchestral music being due to one Knecht, an obscure composer, who wrought in a place, little less unknown, called Biberach. Glorious specimens of descriptive music are Beethoven’s Overtures, all four of them, to Leonore, that to Coriolan, and that to Egmont; and his Sonata representing a farewell, absence, and a return, belongs to the same category. Rossini worked with the brush of a scene-painter in his Overture to Guillaume Tell and in the representations of a storm that divide the action of the second act in the Barbiere, Matilda di Shabran, and other of his comic Operas. Spohr evinced his descriptive power in his Symphonies, the Consecration of Sound, the Contention between Earthliness and Godliness in the soul of man, and the Seasons, and in his Overture to Azor and Zemira, representing the storm, the wreck of the merchant’s vessel, and his magical rescue. Weber’s Concert Stiick tells a complete story of anxiety in absence, a knight’s return, his true love’s eager rush to meet him, and their rapture in each other’s embrace. The success of Mendelssohn has been equal to that of the best of them in his Overtures, and in his Reformation Symphony and in those two orchestral works recording his impressions in Scotland and in Italy. The tone-pictures by Sterndale Bennett, namely, the Naiades, the Wood-Nymphs, and Paradise and the Peri, are each a masterpiece. Latest, if not last, the Abbé Liszt and Herr Raff are writing symphonic poems and Symphonies without the assumption of poetry, purposing to paint in tones the pictures announced in the titles they choose.', 'The Crociato in Egitto succeeded, and was Oberon was given with all ‘the splendour and effect which such a master-piece duced; it is said to cof This, however, is not enough; in order to make a name, individuality of style, invention, warmth and effect are indispensable.

Prout. “Nos. 55, 76 and 103 by the latter gentleman are not only capital examples of what modern church music may be, but areadmirably suited for the period of general musical education, which the compiler of the volume sanguinely awaits. In No. 8&4, which is descriptive of the exultation of the Jews after the passage of the Red Sea, there isa certain Pagan vigour which points to a view of Jewish life and history compatible no doubt with its author's position as the descendant and modern representative of Ambrose and Gregory, but hardly suitable for the purposes of the volume. On the whole we can only conclude by saying that whether the hopes of the editor are realised or not, this collection of anthems will prove acceptable to many who attend and enjoy the choral services of the Church."", 'TheHarmonicon_1833-005.txt_p1010': 'Schmidt was enthusiastically called forward.

{'TheMusicalTimes_1876-397.txt_p461': 'It would be very interesting to know the exact strength of the Duke’s choir and orchestra, but this seems impossible; at least, in Chrysander’s “ Life of Handel’ no information is given on the subject. It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal.
