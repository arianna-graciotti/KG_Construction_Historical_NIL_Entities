What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books.

{'TheMusicalWorld_1843-038.txt_p48': 'of Rameau was represented in 1735, it was a balletopera Les Indes galantes. What was then termed a ballet opera, is now out of use, and itis difficult to define this title of ballet added to that of opera —it did not mean that there was more dancing than in the operas which had only the single title, but it indicated the lightness of the subject, which was mostly graceful, and one of the particularities of this kind of piece was that, when in several parts, the one complete work was composed of various acts which had only connexion with the general title of the work: thus spectacles were often formed, called fragments, which were composed of acts taken from different ballets, which was the more easily done, since each of these acts formed a complete piece. The music of the Indes Galantes, is very pretty, and several pieces have in their time heen very popular, such as the air Papilion inconsiant, the pretiy melody Fuyez, fuyez, vents oragena, rand especially the famous duet Sombres foréts in the act of the savages. The accompaniment of this duet was the Murche des suuvages, which Ramean had already published under that title in one of his harpsichord books. Two years later in 1737, he wrote Castor et Pollux, which is considered his chef d’ wuvre. Amongst other pieces may be cited the chorus Que teut gemisse, the harmony of which is excellent, and the commencement of which is a scale in semi-tones with an imitation la guinte very cleverly introduced.', 'TheMusicalWorld_1843-038.txt_p54': 'T transcribe these pretty words, because it is remarkable that they were written to the music, which was a minuet already published by Rameau amongst his harpsichord music.

{'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p365': ""Jarnowick, known also by. the name of Giornoy ichi, was born at Paris, of Italian parents, and was the favourite scholar of the celebrated Lolli. His debut, however, at the Concert Spirituel, in the first concerto of his master, was by no means successful ; but not discouraged by this failure, he shortly after performed his concerto in A major, in which he gained great applause. For ten years Jarnowick was in great favour with the public. The charactéristics of his style were purity, precision, and elegance, but he failed in producing a vigorous tone, in sensibility of expression, und above all, in his cadences. Being obliged to quit France, Jarnowick was succeeded by Viotti, whose superior talents soon completely eclipsed those of his predecessor. Jarnowick was engaged as leader at the chapel of the Prince Royal of Prussia. He published at Paris seven symphonies and nine concertos for his instrument. 'Two amusing anecdotes are related of him. Being at Lyons, he announced a concert at six francs."", 'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p112': 'MancuHEster, Jan. 29, 1844.—On Saturday evening, Mr. Braham’s concert at the Wellington rooms, was well attended, and the veteran sang to astonish and delight his audience.

But when listening to the \x0c ROSSINI. . 9 operas. of Rossini, we think neither of him nor of his charactersthe singer alone occupies us ; and instead of being moved by the sorrows and emotions of Tancredi, Desdemona, or “ the Moor,” . we are moved only by admiration of the talents of Madame Pasta or Mademoiselle Sontag, displayed in executing the innumerable flights, arpeggios, and cadenzas which are allotted to them.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p440': 'Madame Pasta sung in Selmira, Madame Schutz in La Clemenza di Tito (as Sesto), Mademoiselle Sontag in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Signor Zuchelli in Semiramide. ‘The powers of.all these great artists were combined in several of the operas towar ds the close of the season.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1828-037.txt_p450': 'STATE OF MUSIC IN LONDON. 71 in that perfection which is the effect of these reflected and reci_ procating powers. We disclaim all intention of detracting from the splendid abilities of Mademoiselle Sontag, when we say that she was followed with a fervour that announced her previous well-won reputation, much on the score of novelty. The public did justice to her talents. She also, as opportunity was afforded her, increaséd.the estimation which was at first formed of her, and if her facility of execution and ornament gained her the first laurels, her chaste performance of Mozart’s music and the feeling she evinced when she sung the scene from Weber’s Freischutz, and the airs of her own country and in her own language, in The Swiss family, demonstrated (as we ventured to predict) that the tender and the pathetic were alike within the gifts and attainments of her genius.* | We deduce then from these particulars, that if the public favour has been extended te Mademoiselle Sontag, neither has its regard to Madame Caradori Allan or its admiration of Madame Pasta been reduced by this participation. The truth is that public favour has its varieties and its gradations—and that when once gained it is not easily lost, for habit as well as principle endears the object we have been accustomed to hold in esteem. It is gratifying to the artist and honourable to the patrons of art to know and feel that such are the laws by which the human heart is generally regulated. The affluence of the country is now moreover so much increased, and the love of the fine arts is become sO necessary a concomitant of education, that there is ample room for all competitors of real merit; at the same time it must be palpable that the strain which competion lays upon the faculties of artists allows little opportunity to any but talent of the very highest order. ‘These great names were not however the only attractions with which the excited activity of the managers sought to augment the general and improve their own interest in the King’s Theatre.'}

I could have desired to say something of Weber, Bellini, Rossini, Donizetti, and Mercadante, and to have gone on to advert to Sir George Smart, Sir Henry Bishop, Balfe, Loder, Wallace, Macfarren, and last, not least, Sir William Sterndale Bennett; but I will not attempt to inflict on you a long speech, which would be entirely out of place.

His humour, indeed, is admirable ; and there is often considerable beauty in his pictures of pastoral life, with its feelings and affections, its joys and sorrows. But the feelings he paints are never very refined, nor the affections exalted—the joys are neither rapturous, nor the sorrows deep.

Mozart himself has written nothing more exquisitely tender, nothing more rich in beautiful melody; and here, again, the effect is much enhanced by the orchestral accompaniment (see, for example, the triplet passage for the violins on pages 7o, 71). This chorus leads, immediately to the movement entitled ‘‘ The Earthquake.” This can hardly be considered one of the finest portions of the music. Haydn was more at home in depicting subjects of a tender than of a terrific character, and this chorus appears somewhat conventional in treatment.', 'TheHarmonicon_1824-016.txt_p596': '""We know not the composer of No. 6, but are sure that Mr. Horn might easily have selected a better song, from any collection in his possession. The words are most injudiciously chosen. 7 No. 7, which is meant for the aria d’abilita,-_the shewsong for the first lady,--is a complete failure; though, out of respect to the delightful songstress who throws the shield of her popularity over it, the public applaud it.'}

{'TheMusicalWorld_1843-038.txt_p47': 'One of the principal pieces in Hippolyte et Arcie, is the trio of the Fates, one of the most beautiful compositions of Rameau. It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau.

In the rolling base passage towards the end (page 83, staff 1), Weber gives a strong proof of his regard to instr umental effects—for it strikes us that many composers would have transferred so much of it-as the voice could execute to the vocal part. . - We now arrive at a portion of the opera where it it may be lite*” rally said appear those “ fiery shapes,” which have formed the delight and the fame of the composer. The scene is the invocation of Puck to the spirits; whom he summons to raise a storm and sink the vessel in which the lovers are embarked. It begins with a recitative, more powerful than the general tenor of Weber’s writing in this species. Then follows an allegro __ pesante to the following g poetical lines: Whether ye be in the cavern dark, Lighted alone by the diamond spark, Or beneath the waters deep, ‘Where the prisoned pearl doth sleep.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p618': 'impossible for a free spirit like Weber’s to stoop to any sort of imitation. It is in his own forcible and nervous style, but it possesses neither the concentration, novelty, nor variety of expres-_ sion that ‘mark the school to which (if to any) he may be said to belong. Weber’s genius appears not ofa kind to be confined to the ‘narrower range of ideas necessary to writing for a single instrument ; it is then cramped, and only gives a faint idea of what itis when unrestrained in its natural course. The rondeau is however adapted to afford most excellent pr actice to those who are not so far advanced in their pursuit a as to render it rather i a source of amusement than study.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1825-025.txt_p148': 'The tenor wants the volume and command of the one—the facility and brilliancy of the other.

Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose? Nevertheless, whatever be the exercise proposed, | am_ bold enough to offer myself as a candidate, and doubt not that I shall have a good chance of being blackballed as well as Mr. Flowers, the would be founder of the society.

That part of the tail piece into which the strings are inserted, is to be the same distance from the belly as on the old plan, one extremity of the tail piece only being glued to the instrument ; this part consists of an oval, of one inch and five eighths, by one inch. This oval is divided nearly in half by the groove; the largest division of the two is to be glued to the belly, with the linen or paper underneath ; the remaining bare half-inch that projects beyond the instrument, the deal bracket is to be glued against.']","Your task is to determine the sex or gender of a given person occurring in a given sentence based on some provided relevant context.

I must confess I hate all pedantry and affectation of erudition in music; and Mr. Flowers especially, who has published some fugues full of equivocal points, should be the last man to indulge in a display of it. Decidedly he would have a hard push to gain admittance into the society he purposes to establish if an unodjectionable fugue be the exercise proposed. I would much rather have a sonata made the test of eligibility, and then we should possess some chance of the poetry of music not being altogether lost sight of by the members, which is far beyond the mere dry machinery: however, if the 150 bar fugue, with the subject 150 times in each bar, be insisted on, let Mr. Flowers begin, and I will bet him ten fugnes to a canon on the octave, that he will be blackballed for incompetency, and that without impugning his musical capabilities. I merely wish to show that his proposition is extravagant, if not nonsensical, I like his society, however, though it had better be named the ‘‘ Contrapuntists Society,’’ which means something, than the ‘* Counterpunists,” which can signify nothing, if not a ready knack at answering puns by puns, or counterpunning. Why invent new words when there are old ones to suit the purpose? Nevertheless, whatever be the exercise proposed, | am_ bold enough to offer myself as a candidate, and doubt not that I shall have a good chance of being blackballed as well as Mr. Flowers, the would be founder of the society. By the way, who are to be the judges? This Mr. Flowers has forgotten to say.', 'TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview_1824-022.txt_p190': 'I feel confident that an orchestra with instruments fitted upon this principle, would require tuning but once in the course of a concert, provided the instruments were previously kept to concert pitch, and not strung with new strings, which must necessarily ‘stretch ; but.on the old plan, when one string is tuned it affects ihe rest, the tail piece being a moveable lever, which inconvenience is removed by its being, according to my improved plan, a fixture; neither is it subject to be acted on by the occasional pres- gure of the chin. That part of the tail piece into which the strings are inserted, is to be the same distance from the belly as on the old plan, one extremity of the tail piece only being glued to the instrument ; this part consists of an oval, of one inch and five eighths, by one inch. This oval is divided nearly in half by the groove; the largest division of the two is to be glued to the belly, with the linen or paper underneath ; the remaining bare half-inch that projects beyond the instrument, the deal bracket is to be glued against.'}

Sentence: ""On the Ist of April following, Judas Maccabeus was reproduced, which had been brought out in the previous year as an ode of victory, a musical ovation, to William, Duke of Cumberland, in honour of his success against the unfortunate Charles Edward; and, on its reproduction, the song of triumph was interpolated into it from the other work, for, we may well believe, it had already become popular, although it had been first heard but three weeks before, and it embodied to the very life the people’s feelings; and since that occasion the piece has been integral to both Oratorios.""

Gospel through the world, it. is likely that with the sacred writings was also diffused the ancient music of the psalms in opposition to the profane songs of the Gentiles. When the apostle Paul, writing to the Ephesians, the Corinthians, and the Colossians, exhorts them to’ praise the Lord in psalms and hymns—when the same holy apostle with his coadjutor Sillus, in Macedonia, were first flagellated, then imprisoned, and in the middle of the night made their dungeons resound with MARTINI’S HISTORY. | 59 sacred songs—and when finally the apostle St. John recommends the faithful to sing hymns of thanksgiving to the Almighty, these apostolic exhortations would have doubtless been useless, if they had not been accompanied with the proper psalms to be sung and the manner of singing them. After having traced Hebrew music.', 'It would be very interesting to know the exact strength of the Duke’s choir and orchestra, but this seems impossible; at least, in Chrysander’s “ Life of Handel’ no information is given on the subject. It appears, however, highly probable that it was at first very small, and that the three-part anthems were the first composed ; and this probability is heightened by the fact that they are, on the whole, less mature works than those in four and five parts. Most likely, the Duke, finding he had such a composer for his church, thought it worth while to increase his choir by engaging more men, so as to give Handel two, or even three tenor parts, instead of the one with which at first he had to content himself. On this point, we learn a curious fact from Dr. Chrysander. It was Handel’s habit frequently to write in his scores, instead of the class of voice, the name of the singers to whom that particular part was allotted. He had done this with some of the later Chandos anthems, and the names found are those of the principal singers of the Chapel Royal. It thus appears that the Duke increased the strength of his choir, not by engaging new members, but by obtaining the assistance of the King’s choristers.', 'In the year 1725, Philidor, musicien de la chambre du Roi, and elder brother to the celebrated composer of that name, obtained from M. Francine, at that time manager of the opera, permission to give a series of concerts on those days, during the Lent season, on which, no performance took place.

Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough.

{'TheMusicalWorld_1844-006.txt_p35': ""would be glad in the present dearth of tenors to pleton illustrate Scotch melodies, Mr. Horncastle The most successful of Mr. Horncastle, He is essentially a stage singer, and managers avail themselves of his undoubted talents, but he is a very impracticable man to deal with. Seeing the success of his rival, Wilson, in musical entertainments, he has launched forth as an imitator; but on this topic more anon, Wilson isa right-minded, thoroughly honest man. He has not the slightest particle of quackery in his competition. It was as far hack as 1835, we believe, that he began his lectures on music at the Mechanics’ Institution in London, and on his tour in the United States he opened a regular system of entertainments. His triumph here on his return was prodigious, and caused his abandonment of the stage. It will be gathered from the above details that no very great affection can exist between the two Scotch tenors, and some sparring has therefore taken place. Mr. Wilson, on Monday, began the attack by explaining that the subject of Mary’s history had been prepared by him a year since, but that a domestic calamity (the death of a child) had caused its postponement. Mr. Wilson hinted that, as he had made no secret in musical circles of his intentions, Mr. Templeton must be regarded as poaching on his manor, a system which he (Mr. Wilson) should think but an ill requital of the public patronage he had been honoured with. Mr. Templeton, on Thursday, per contra, declared that he had no notion of ‘‘arrogating to himself the exclusive right of lecturing on Burns, but that he was justified in pointing out the poet’s beauties, having been born in the same county, and his father and Burns having been friends.”” Mr. Wilson’s adherents cheered his allusions very lustily, and so did Mr. Templeton’s supporters applaud his thrusts. In fact, if the audiences had been Hibernian instead of Scotch they could not have displayed a more mischievous desire to provoke a ‘ scrimmaze’’ between the two tenors. «As to the matter contained in the new entertainments, there is little to require notice. Mr, Wilson’s lecture was distinguished, as usual, by its good sense, and his vocal illustrations were exquisite, becanse simplicity of text was strictly adhered to. But one admission at the outset, creditable to the candour of the lecturer, destroyed its interest, as affording information of the music of Mary’s times. Mr. Wilson admi'ted that we were completely in the dark, and that nothing but “titles of song,’’ had. come down. This is true enough. We have nothing of Scotch melodies before the time of Charles the Second, when the first published versions of them appeared. Mr Wilson had therefore avatled him<elf of the talents of Mir. Hallantine, of Udinburwh, to write the words of sonzs illustrative of the lecture to which melodies banded down by tradition were appended.
